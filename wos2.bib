Abstract = {Background The aim of the study was to evaluate trends of mortality and
   the number of years of life lost due to lung cancer in Poland, in the
   period 2000-2016. Methods The study material was 375,151 death
   certificates of all inhabitants of Poland who died in the period
   2000-2016 due to lung cancer. In order to calculate the number of years
   of life lost, the authors used indices: SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years
   of Life Lost per living person), SEYLLd (per deaths), APC (Annual
   Percentage Change) and AAPC (Average Annual Percentage Change). Results
   The standardized death rate (SDR) due to lung cancer decreased in the
   analyzed period from 74.5 to 68.3 per 100,000 population (AAPC =
   -0.6\%). The most rapid decrease was noted in the years 2008-2011 (APC =
   -2.2\%). With regards to males, SDR decreased from 148.8 to 114.5 (AAPC
   = -1.7\%), whereas in females, it increased from 25.7 to 37.6 (AAPC =
   2.3\%). The SEYLLp index, calculated per 100,000 inhabitants, increased
   from 1189.9 in the year 2000 to 1250.5 in the year 2016. The trend and
   pace of changes fluctuated. In 2000-2008, the SEYLLp index was
   increasing at a pace of 0.7\%. This growth was followed by a decrease at
   a pace of -1.2\%, noted in 2008-2011. After the year 2011, the indices
   started to grow at an annual pace of 0.4\%. AAPC in the whole study
   period was 0.3\%. Increased mortality in females was responsible for the
   increase in the number of lost years of life. SEYLLp values in this sex
   group increased from 464.8 in the year 2000 to 774.7 in the year 2016
   (APC = 3.3\%).With regards to males, SEYLLp values, calculated for
   100,000 male population, decreased in the analyzed period from 1961.1 to
   1758.3. Conclusions Lung cancer still poses a serious epidemiological
   problem in Poland and the number of years of life lost due to this cause
   reflects social and economic implications of premature lung
   cancer-related mortality. There is a great need to educate, particularly
   women, and show effective ways of quitting smoking.},

Title = {Comprehensive indicators of traffic-related premature mortality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1117-1139},
Abstract = {Motor vehicle circulation is associated with multiple social benefits;
   nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that it also produces a variety
   of adverse health effects, of which the most relevant are associated
   with mortality from road accidents and exposure to atmospheric
   pollution. Though in Chile these impacts have been quantified and
   evaluated independently, no indicators have been developed so far to
   account for this activity's global impact on public health, or to
   express the individual impact that can be attributed to each vehicle
   category. In order to fill this void, the present study aimed at
   designing and quantifying indicators that account for the global impact
   on health that different motor vehicle categories impose on Chilean
   society. Health impact was quantified as the number of expected
   premature deaths caused by road accidents and exposure to atmospheric
   pollutants. Total premature mortality was understood as the total annual
   deaths that occurred as a consequence of road accidents and the exposure
   to O-3 and PM2.5 derived from traffic-related emissions of its
   precursors. All estimations were made considering Chile's Metropolitan
   Region in 2005 as a basic scenario. Differentiated indicators were
   obtained for 15 vehicle categories as a function of different
   parameters: traveled kilometer, vehicle, and vehicle lifetime. According
   to our results, when the health impact of traffic accidents and exposure
   to traffic-related air pollution are considered simultaneously, major
   differences were observed with the indicators traditionally used by
   regulators involved in the traffic-related decision-making process. The
   implications of our results on risk management strategies are discussed.},

Abstract = {The air in Tehran is one of the most polluted airs in the entire world.
   Because of the air pollution in the Great Tehran area, morbidity,
   mortality and symptoms emerge. This study has been conducted for the
   first time in Iran. According to this study the total annual direct
   medical costs of morbidity estimated at US\$ 3258255.48.Our work also
   led to the estimation of an income elasticity of WTP for reduction in
   the probability of premature mortality,that is, an income elasticity of
   the value of a statistical life. The total annual mortality damage cost
   estimated at US\$ 23 2538684.38. Contingent valuation (CV) was utilized
   in order to place monetary values on symptoms. By using CV, the economic
   value of each symptoms was estimated per person per day. The use of CV
   in this study required that a questionnaire be prepared and the
   Willingness to Pay of Tehran citizens be estimated by a random sampling.
   Finally the total health damage costs of air pollution in Tehran or
   benefits of reducing air pollution estimated at US\$ 663776276 annually.},

Abstract = {Objectives: to analyze premature mortality and Potential Years of Life
   Lost by noncommunicable diseases in a city in the countryside of Sao
   Paulo from 2010 to 2014. Methods: ecological study of temporal tendency,
   using secondary source. For analysis, the premature mortality
   coefficient and the Potential Years of Life Lost indicator were used.
   Results: males had the highest premature mortality rate due to
   cardiovascular disease, with 213.04 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants,
   followed by neoplasms, with 188.44. In women, there was an inversion
   with 134.22 deaths from cancer and 110.71 deaths from cardiovascular
   disease. Regarding Potential Years of Life Lost, males had an average of
   12.19 years lost by death and females of 13.45 years lost. Conclusions:
   the results reinforce the need to increase public health prevention and
   promotion policies to reduce premature deaths, especially among men.},

Abstract = {In Japan, all 47 prefectures conduct routine air quality monitoring at
   1145 stations throughout the country to assess environmental effects.
   This study aims to provide a better understanding of possible
   estimations of premature mortality in Japan caused by exposure to
   monitored and modeled concentrations of tropospheric ozone during the
   period from January to December, 2005. The spatial distribution and
   temporal variation of ozone concentrations were modeled using the
   Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system coupled with
   the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (CMAQJ REAS). Premature
   mortality caused by exposure to ozone was calculated assuming a relative
   risk (RR) value of 1.003 {[}95\% Confidence Interval (Cl): 1.001-1.004]
   for concentrations above 35 ppb according to the SOM035 index (annual
   Sum of daily maximum 8-h Ozone Means Over 35 ppb) recommended by WHO
   (2008). Based on CMAQ/REAS simulations, the estimated all-cause
   premature mortality in 2005 is about 13,000 (95\% Cl: 4320-17,300)
   cases. This value is 2.5 times greater than the estimated premature
   mortality based on monitored ozone concentrations, which is 5220 (95\%
   CI: 1740-6960) cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Burden of dust storms on years of life lost in Seoul, South Korea: A
   distributed lag analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {296},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Although dust storms have been associated with adverse health outcomes,
   studies on the burden of dust storms on deaths are limited. As global
   warming has induced significant climate changes in recent decades, which
   have accelerated desertification worldwide, it is necessary to evaluate
   the burden of dust storm-induced premature mortality using a critical
   measure of disease burden, such as the years of life lost (YLL). The YLL
   attributable to dust storms have not been examined to date. This study
   investigated the association between Asian dust storms (ADS) and the YLL
   in Seoul, South Korea, during 2002-2013. We conducted a time-series
   study using a generalized additive model assuming a Gaussian
   distribution and applied a distributed lag model with a maximum lag of 5
   days to investigate the delayed and cumulative effects of ADS on the
   YLL. We also conducted stratified analyses using the cause of death
   (respiratory and cardiovascular diseases) and sociodemographic status
   (sex, age, education level, occupation, and marital status). During the
   study period, 108 ADS events occurred, and the average daily YLL was
   1511 years due to non-accidental causes. The cumulative ADS exposure
   over the 6-day lag period was associated with a significant increase of
   104.7 (95\% CI, 31.0-178.5 years) and 34.4 years (4.0-64.7 years) in the
   YLL due to non-accidental causes and cardiovascular mortality,
   respectively. Sociodemographic analyses revealed associations between
   ADS exposure and the YLL in males, both <65 and >= 65 years old, those
   with middle-level education, and the unemployed, unmarried, and widowed
   (26.5-83.8 years). This study provides new evidence suggesting that
   exposure to dust storms significantly increases the YLL. Our findings
   suggest that dust storms are a critical environmental risk affecting
   premature mortality. These results could contribute to the establishment
   of public health policies aimed at managing dust storm exposure and
   reducing premature deaths.},

Abstract = {The study aims to explore the main drivers influencing the economic
   appraisal of heat warning systems by integrating epidemiological
   modelling and benefit-cost analysis. To shed insights on heat wave
   mortality valuation, we consider three valuation schemes: (i) a
   traditional one, where the value of a statistical life (VSL) is applied
   to both displaced and premature mortality; (ii) an intermediate one,
   with VSL applied for premature mortality and value of a life year (VOLY)
   for displaced mortality; and (iii) a conservative one, where both
   premature and displaced mortality are quantified in terms of loss of
   life expectancy, and then valued using the VOLY approach. When applying
   these three schemes to Madrid (Spain), we obtain a benefit-cost ratio
   varying from 12 to 3700. We find that the choice of the valuation scheme
   has the largest influence, whereas other parameters such as attributable
   risk, displaced mortality ratio, or the comprehensiveness and
   effectiveness of the heat warning system are less influential. The
   results raise the question of which is the most appropriate approach to
   value mortality in the context of heat waves, given that the lower bound
   estimate for the benefit-cost ratio (option iii using VOLY) is up to two
   orders of magnitude lower than the value based on the traditional VSL
   approach (option i). The choice of the valuation methodology has
   significant implications for public health authorities at the local and
   regional scale, which becomes highly relevant for locations where the
   application of the VOLY approach could lead to benefit-cost ratios
   significantly lower than 1. We propose that specific metrics for
   premature and displaced VOLYs should be developed for the context of
   heat waves. Until such values are available, we suggest testing the
   economic viability of heat warning systems under the three proposed
   valuation schemes (i-iii) and using values for VOLY commonly applied in
   air pollution as the health end points are similar. Lastly, periodical
   reassessment of heat alert plans should be performed by public health
   authorities to monitor their long-term viability and cost-effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Several recent articles have pointed to the effect of social context on
   heart disease mortality after adjusting for individual level indicators.
   This study investigates the contributions of individual socioeconomic
   factors (sex, race, and education) and social context at the
   neighborhood level (wealth, education, social capital, and racial/ethnic
   composition), and the county level (social inequality, human and social
   capital, economic and demographic characteristics) on premature
   cardiovascular mortality. Death certificate information was obtained for
   all those who died of heart disease in Texas, USA, in 1991. Deaths were
   geocoded to obtain block-group, census tract, and county social context
   from the census. Multilevel hierarchical models quantified the
   contributions of individual characteristics and block-group, tract, and
   county social context on years of potential life lost to heart disease.
   Cross-level analyses investigated the interaction between individual and
   contextual factors. Being female, having more education, and residing in
   areas with higher median house value were associated with less premature
   mortality. Although blacks and Hispanics lost more years of life to
   heart disease than whites, blacks and Hispanics living in tracts with
   higher own racial/ethnic group density lost fewer years of life than
   their peers living in less homogenous tracts. At the county level,
   premature mortality was negatively associated with social capital. The
   tract and county level variances were statistically significant
   indicating the importance of social context to premature heart disease
   mortality. Plausible mechanisms through which these effects operate are
   explored. Social context at the block-group, tract, and county level
   played an important role, though a smaller role than individual factors,
   in explaining years of life lost to heart disease. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Title = {Measuring the local burden of disease. A study of years of life lost in

Abstract = {Background An effective health policy necessitates a reliable
   characterization of the burden of disease (BOD) by cause. The Global
   Burden of Disease Study (GBDS) aims to deliver this information. For
   sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in particular, the GBDS relies on
   extrapolations and expert guesses. Its results lack validation by
   locally measured epidemiological data.
   Methods This study presents locally measured BOD data for a health
   district in Burkina Faso and compares them to the results of the GBDS
   for SSA. As BOD indicator, standard years of life lost (age-weighted
   YLL, discounted with a discount rate of 3\%) are used as proposed by the
   GBDS. To investigate the influence of different age and time preference
   weights on our results, the BOD pattern is again estimated using, first,
   YLL with no discounting and no age-weighting, and, second, mortality
   figures.
   Results Our data exhibit the same qualitative BOD pattern as the GBDS
   results regarding age and gender. We estimated that 53.9\% of the BOD is
   carried by men, whereas the GBDS reported this share to be 53.2\%. The
   ranking of diseases by BOD share, though, differs substantially.
   Malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections occupy the
   first three ranks in our study and in the GBDS, only differing in their
   respective order. Protein-energy malnutrition, bacterial meningitis and
   intestinal nematode infections occupy ranks 5, 6 and 7 in Nouna but
   ranks 15, 27 and 38 in the GBDS. The results are not sensitive to the
   different age and time preference weights used. Specifically, the choice
   of parameters matters less than the choice of indicator.
   Conclusion Local health policy should rather be based on local BOD
   measurement instead of relying on extrapolations that might not
   represent the true BOD structure by cause.},

Title = {Years of life lost by COVID-19 in Portugal and comparison with other

Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been measured in
   different metrics, mostly by counting deaths and its impact on health
   services. Few studies have attempted to calculate years of life lost
   (YLL) to COVID-19 and compare it with YLL due to other causes in
   different countries.MethodsWe calculated YLL to COVID-19 from week10 to
   week52 in 2020 for eight European countries by methods defined by the
   WHO. We calculated excess YLL by subtracting the average YLL from 2017
   to 2019 to the YLL in 2020. Our analysis compared YLL to COVID-19 and
   the excess YLL of non-COVID-19 causes across countries in
   Europe.ResultsPortugal registered 394,573 cases and 6619 deaths due to
   COVID-19, accounting for 25,395 YLL in just 10months. COVID-19 was
   responsible for 6.7\% of all deaths but accounted for only 4.2\% of all
   YLL. We estimate that Portugal experienced an excess of 35,510 YLL
   (+6.2\%), of which 72\% would have been due to COVID-19 and 28\% due to
   non-COVID-19 causes. Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands experienced
   excess YLL to non-COVID-19 causes. We also estimated that Portugal
   experienced an excess of 10,115 YLL due to cancer (3805), cardiovascular
   diseases (786) and diseases of the respiratory system
   (525).ConclusionCOVID-19 has had a major impact on mortality rates in
   Portugal, as well as in other European countries. The relative impact of
   COVID-19 on the number of deaths has been greater than on the number of
   YLL, because COVID-19 deaths occur mostly in advanced ages.},

Title = {The burden of ambient temperature on years of life lost: A
   multi-community analysis in Hubei, China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},

Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Background: Compared with death rates, years of life lost (YLL) has been
   widely used as a more informative indicator to quantify the burden of
   premature death. In the context of global climate change, existing
   evidence linking ambient temperatures and YLL was very scarce across the
   globe.
   Methods: Daily mortality and meteorological data during 2009-2012 were
   obtained from 12 communities across Hubei Province in central China. A
   two-stage approach was used for statistical analysis. At the first
   stage, a generalized linear regression combined with distributed lag
   non-linear model was applied to estimate community-specific
   temperature-YLL associations. A second-stage multivariable meta-analysis
   was then conducted to pool the community-specific estimates of
   temperature-related effects on YLL.
   Results: A pooled J- or U-shaped association was observed between
   ambient temperature and YLL due to different mortality categories. Heat
   effects occurred immediately and only persisted for several days,
   whereas cold effects were delayed and much longer-lasting. At the
   provincial level, heat effect (per 1 degrees C increase from 75th to
   99th percentile of temperature) at lag 0-2 days and cold effect (per 1
   degrees C decrease from 25th to 1st percentile of temperature) at lag
   0-21 days was associated with an increase of 1.91\% (95\% CI: 0.83,
   3.00) and 5.09\% (2.79, 7.40) in YLL due to non-accidental deaths,
   respectively. Much greater effect estimates of cold than heat were also
   observed for other mortality-specific YLLs (except for respiratory
   mortality). Heat effects on YLL were higher for males and the youth,
   while cold effects were greater for females and the elderly.
   Additionally, relatively stronger associations between heat, cold and
   YLL were consistently observed in low-educated persons.
   Conclusions: This multi-community study strengthened the evidence that
   both cold and hot temperatures were associated with increased years of
   life lost. Our findings may have important implications for better
   understanding the burden of premature death related to temperature
   extremes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Asthma is a prevalent disease in both children and adults.
   Significant progress in the management of asthma and prevention of
   asthmatic attacks resulted in a reduction of asthma deaths, but there is
   a variation among different regions based on health-care access and
   environmental factors. We aimed to investigate the trend of asthma
   mortality during a 10-year period in Yazd Province, a region in the
   center of Iran. Methods: We obtained our data from the death registry of
   Yazd health center. This registry collects data from hospitals, clinics,
   forensic medicine department, and cemeteries. All deaths due to asthma
   from 2002 to 2011 were included in our study. We used the remaining life
   expectancy of each person at death and sex group to calculate the years
   of life lost (YLL) due to asthma. Results: Nearly 10,371 years of life
   was lost due to asthma in our study (M/F ratio of 1.29). Asthma
   mortality rate increased with age, rising sharply after age 50. Average
   YLL per death was 18.6 years. Asthma mortality rate decreased from
   6.66/100,000 in 2002 to 3.97 in 2011. YLL from asthma among men
   decreased from 796 in 2002 to 338 in 2011, but among women, it showed an
   increase from 335 to 534 at the same time. Conclusion: The trend of
   reduction in asthma mortality is not similar between different age and
   gender groups. Further studies are needed to determine the cause of
   increasing trend among more vulnerable groups.},

Title = {Epidemiological changes, demographic drivers, and global years of life
   lost from suicide over the period 1990-2019},
Journal = {SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR},
Abstract = {Objective To quantify the contributions of epidemiological changes (age-
   and gender-specific suicide rates) and demographic forces (population
   growth and aging) to global changes in years of life lost (YLLs) from
   suicide over the last 30 years. Method A decomposition analysis was used
   to assess the impacts of population growth, population aging, and
   suicide prevalence on global changes in YLLs from suicide between 1990
   and 2019. Results From 1990 to 2019, global YLLs from suicide reduced by
   2,073,714 years (5.9\%), from 35,246,316 years to 33,172,602 years. This
   was mainly due to the decline in age-specific suicide rates, which
   reduced the overall YLLs from suicide by 20,185,691 years (973.4\%).
   However, this decline was offset by the impacts of population growth and
   population aging, which increased global YLLs from suicide by 14,949,110
   years (-720.9\%) and 3,442,074 years (-166.0\%), respectively. The
   combined effects of epidemiological and demographic drivers were also
   reflected in different trends in YLLs from suicide across genders and
   World Bank income level regions, with particularly notable increases in
   low- income and lower-middle income countries and the aging population.
   Conclusions With the significant effects of epidemiological and
   demographic drivers, global and regional YLLs from suicide may be
   expected to change greatly in the future. Efforts to reduce the burden
   of suicide require appropriate allocation of resources for
   suicide-prevention strategies and further consideration of demographic
   factors.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of the study was to quantify the burden of premature
   mortality because of opioid overdose in Ohio, document the role of
   fentanyl poisoning in contribution to this evolving epidemic, examine
   geographic, demographic, and temporal patterns of mortality burden
   within Ohio, and measure the effect of opioid overdose on lifespan in
   the state. Methods: A serial cross-sectional analysis was performed for
   all fatal opioid poisonings (N = 12,782) in the state of Ohio between
   January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2016. The burden of fatal opioid
   overdose was calculated in Years of Life Lost (YLL). YLL were mapped
   with respect to geographic and cultural region. The geographic spread of
   fentanyl poisoning was also mapped, and the shifting contribution of
   fentanyl poisoning to overall opioid mortality burden was assessed over
   time. Finally, the negative effect of opioid overdose on average
   lifespan was calculated. Results: Opioid overdose resulted in 508,451
   total YLL. In the year 2016 alone, there were 136,679 YLL attributable
   to opioid poisoning. Fentanyl-related YLL rose from 7.5\% of all YLL
   because of opioid overdose in 2010 to 69.0\% in 2016. In the same year,
   opioid overdose lowered the lifespan of an average Ohioan by 0.97 years.
   Conclusions: Fatal opioid overdose accounted for over half a million YLL
   in Ohio during the 7-year study period. Opioid overdose mortality rose
   annually. Fentanyl involved overdoses accounted for a growing proportion
   of excess mortality. Burden was not equally distributed within the
   state. Two distinct geographical clusters of excess mortality were
   identified in the northeast and south.},

Abstract = {To estimate the years of life lost (YLL), registered deaths due to
   Iraq-Iran war (1980-2005) were identified considering ICD10 codes of
   Y36.0 to Y36.9. Estimated YLL was calculated by taking age-weighting
   options and discount rates. Population life expectancy in each
   corresponding year was retrieved from the national health database.
   During 1980-2005, 178,298 Iranian men and 5325 Iranian women died in
   war. The mean death age was 22.8 +/- 9years, 96.6\% occurred during the
   years of war (September 1980-August 1988). In the years after the war
   (1988-2005) 6243 (3.4\%) of deaths occurred as the result of
   complication of the war-related injuries or implanted
   landmines/unexploded ordnances (ICD10 code: Y36.8). YLL in Iraq-Iran war
   among Iranian victims were calculated as 10,479,405.0years considering
   the age weighting and discount rate equal to 0. Age-adjusted YLL were
   estimated as 10,169,546.2years in males. Female cases that comprised
   2.9\% of total victims lost 309,858.8years. The mean YLL was calculated
   as 57.1years for each Iranian victim killed in Iraq-Iran war. The
   war-related YLL was estimated more than 10 million years that comprised
   a majority of young men. This study is the first step in estimation of
   disability adjusted life year (DALY) of Iraq-Iran war on Iranian side.},

Title = {Developing a novel indicator to estimate years of life lost attributable
   to temperature variability between neighboring days},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The evidence is limited for the mortality burden of temperature
   variability between neighboring days. This study developed a novel
   indicator to measure temperature variability between neighboring days
   and quantify its mortality burden. Daily mortality and meteorological
   data during 2006-2017 from 364 locations across China were collected. We
   first employed a distributed lag non-linear model and multivariable
   meta-analysis to investigate the association between the diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) with the years of life lost (YLL) rate and the
   association between the nocturnal temperature range (NTR) with the YLL
   rate. Then, we calculated the weight temperature variability between
   neighboring days (weight-TVN) based on the attributable YLL rate of the
   DTR and NTR. The relationship between the weight-TVN and YLL rate was
   analyzed, and the attributable fraction (AF) of the YLL and weight-TVN
   related life loss per death was calculated to quantify the mortality
   burden. Stratified analyses were conducted by region, season, gender,
   age group and cause of death. The DTR-YLL rate curve and NTR-YLL rate
   curve were both J-shaped and a higher YLL rate attributable to DTR was
   observed than NTR. There was a significant association between the
   weight-TVN and YLL rate. An estimated AF of the weight-TVN was 6.02\%
   (95\%CI: 3.71\%-8.33\%). The average life loss per death due to
   weight-TVN was 0.93 year (95\%CI: 0.57-1.29). Stratification analyses
   showed that the AFs of weight-TVN were relatively larger in southern
   China, in the cold season, in the elderly, females and patients with
   respiratory illnesses. Although the AF of weight-TVN among the young
   group (AF = 4.74\%, 95\%CI: 1.79\%-7.69\%) was lower than for the
   elderly (AF = 6.06\%, 95\%CI: 3.72\%-8.41\%), weight-TVN related life
   loss per death among the young population (1.51, 95\%CI: 0.57-2.45) was
   much higher than in the elderly (0.59, 95\%CI: 0.36-0.82). A novel
   indicator to measure temperature variability between neighboring days
   was developed, and temperature fluctuation between adjacent days
   significantly increased the mortality burden. Our results indicate that
   more attention should be paid to short-term temperature fluctuation.},

Title = {Years of life lost and mortality due to heat and cold in the three
   largest English cities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {There is a well-established relationship between temperature and
   mortality, with older individuals being most at risk in high-income
   settings. This raises the question of the degree to which lives are
   being shortened by exposure to heat or cold. Years of life lost (YLL)
   take into account population life expectancy and age at which mortality
   occurs. However, YLL are rarely used as an outcome-metric in studies of
   temperature-related mortality. This represents an important gap in
   knowledge; to better comprehend potential impacts of temperature in the
   context of climate change and an ageing population, it is important to
   understand the relationship between temperature and YLL, and also
   whether the risks of temperature related mortality and YLL have changed
   over recent years.
   Gridded temperature data derived from observations, and mortality data
   were provided by the UK Met Office and the Office for National
   Statistics (ONS), respectively. We derived YLL for each death using
   sex-specific yearly life expectancy from ONS English-national
   lifetables. We undertook an ecological time-series regression analysis,
   using a distributed-lag double-threshold model, to estimate the
   relationship between daily mean temperature and daily YLL and mortality
   between 1996 and 2013 in Greater London, the West Midlands including
   Birmingham, and Greater Manchester. Temperature-thresholds, as
   determined by model best fit, were set at the 91st (for heat-effects)
   and 35th (for cold-effects) percentiles of the mean temperature
   distribution. Secondly, we analysed whether there had been any changes
   in heat and cold related risk of YLL and mortality over time.
   Heat-effects (lag 0-2 days) were greatest in London, where for each 1
   degrees C above the heat-threshold the risk of mortality increased by
   3.9\% (CI 3.5\%, 4.3\%) and YLL increased by 3.0\% (2.5\%, 3.5\%).
   Between 1996 and 2013, the proportion of total deaths and YLL
   attributable to heat in London were 0.50\% and 0.40\% respectively.
   Cold-effects (lag 0-27 days) were greatest in the West Midlands, where
   for each 1 degrees C below the cold-threshold, risk of mortality
   increased by 3.1\% (2.4\%, 3.7\%) and YLL also increased by 3.1\%
   (2.2\%, 3.9\%). The proportion of deaths and YLL attributable to cold in
   the West Midlands were 3.3\% and 3.2\% respectively. We found no
   evidence of decreasing susceptibility to heat and cold over time.
   The addition of life expectancy information into calculations of
   temperature-related risk and mortality burdens for English cities is
   novel. We demonstrate that although older individuals are at greatest
   risk of temperature-related mortality, heat and cold still make a
   significant contribution to the YLL due to premature death.},

Title = {End-stage renal disease-financial costs and years of life lost in
   Panama: a cost-analysis study},

Abstract = {Objectives Central America is a region with an elevated burden of
   chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the cost of treatment for
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains an understudied area. This study
   aimed to investigate the direct costs associated with haemodialysis (HD)
   and peritoneal dialysis (PD) in public and private institutions in
   Panama in 2015, to perform a 5-year budget impact analysis and to
   calculate the years of life lost (YLL) due to CKD.
   Design A retrospective cost-analysis study using hospital costs and
   registry-based data.
   Setting Data on direct costs were derived from the public and private
   sectors from two institutions from Panama. Data on CKD-related mortality
   were obtained from the National Mortality Registry.
   Methods A budget impact analysis was performed from the payer
   perspective, and five scenarios were estimated, with the assumption that
   the mix of dialysis modality use shifts towards a greater use of PD over
   time. The YLL due to CKD was calculated using data recorded between 1
   January 2015 and 31 December 2015. The linear method was utilised for
   the analyses with the population aged 20-77 years old.
   Results In 2015, the total costs for dialysis in the public sector
   ranged from similar to US\$7.9 million (PD) to US\$62 million (HD). The
   estimated costs were higher in the scenario in which a decrease in PD
   was assumed. The average annual loss due to CKD was 25 501 808.40
   US\$-YLL.
   Conclusion ESRD represents a major challenge for Panama. Our results
   suggest that an increased use of PD might provide an opportunity to
   substantially lower overall ESRD treatment costs.},

Abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to assess alcohol-related
   mortality and years of life lost (YLL) in Poland between 1999 and 2017.
   Methods: A database of 7,168,765 death certificates of Polish residents
   who died in 1999-2017 was reviewed. This number included 112,512 people
   who had died due to alcohol consumption. YLL was calculated with the use
   of the Standard Expected Years of Life Lost (SEYLL) measure; its value
   was related to the size of the study population and calculated per
   100,000 people (SEYLLp). Time trends were determined by joinpoint
   regression analysis. Results: In 1999, the SEYLLp value was 653.99 years
   among males and 71.20 years among females; in 2017, these numbers rose
   to 1,263.76 and 293.10 years, respectively. Time trend analysis revealed
   that SEYLLp increased more quickly in females (by 8.69 \% per year) than
   in males (by 3.68 \%). The ratio of male to female SEYLLp values
   decreased from 9.18 to 4.31 over the study period. Conclusions: In
   Poland, both males and females are experiencing adverse changes in the
   number of alcoholinduced YLLs. However, the disparity in YLLs between
   males and females is gradually decreasing, primarily due to the value
   increasing more quickly in females.},

Abstract = {The deteriorating air quality in Chinese cities is attracting growing
   public concern. We conducted analyses to quantify the associations
   between daily changes in ambient air pollution and mortality in Nanjing,
   China. Daily mortality, air pollution, and meteorological data from 1
   January 2009 to 31 December 2013 were collected. Over dispersed Poisson
   regression models were used to evaluate the risk of daily non-accidental
   mortality and years of life lost (YLL) from exposure to respirable
   particulate matter (PM10) and gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2). Stratified
   analysis was conducted to indentify the modifying effect of
   individual-level factors on the association between air pollutants and
   mortality. We found that interquartile range (IQR) increases in the
   two-day average of PM10, NO2 and SO2 were significantly associated with
   1.6\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.7\%-2.6\%], 2.9\% (95\% CI:
   1.7\%-4.2\%) and 2.4\% (95\% CI: 1.2\%-3.6\%) higher rates of
   non-accidental mortality; and related to YLL increases of 20.5 (95\% CI:
   6.3-34.8), 34.9 (95\% CI: 16.9-52.9) and 30.3 (95\% CI: 12.2-48.4)
   years, respectively; Associations between air pollution and mortality
   were more pronounced in the warm season than in the cool season. We
   conclude that the risks of mortality and YLL were elevated corresponding
   to an increase in current ambient concentrations of the air pollutants,
   and season may modify the effects of outdoor air pollution in Nanjing.

Title = {Lifetime risks, expected years of life lost, and cost-per-life year of
   esophageal cancer in Taiwan},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Besides lifetime risks, we estimated life expectancy (LE), expected
   years of life lost (EYLL), lifetime costs, and cost-per-LY (life-year)
   stratified by different stages of esophageal cancer (EC). From the
   Taiwan Cancer Registry, we collected 14,420 EC to estimate the incidence
   rates during 2008-2014. They were followed to 2015 to obtain the
   survival function, which was extrapolated to lifetime by a
   semiparametric method. We abstracted the monthly healthcare expenditures
   from the reimbursement database of National Health Insurance, which were
   multiplied with the corresponding survival probabilities to quantify
   lifetime cost and cost-per-LY after adjustments. About 93.7\% of
   patients were male; 90.8\% had squamous cell carcinoma. Most patients
   were diagnosed at advanced stages, with 44.6\% and 28.3\% at stages III
   and IV. The lifetime risk of EC in males increased in Taiwan with a
   cumulative incidence rate (CIR30-84) of 0.0146\% (2008 similar to 2010)
   to 0.0165\% (2013-2014). The EYLL for stages I-IV were 15.8, 17.5, 20.5,
   and 22.5, while the average of cost-per-LY for stages I-IV were US\$
   6,987, \$8,776, \$12,153, and \$22,426. EC in Taiwan appears to have
   shifted into younger ages groups and incidence is still increasing.
   Strategies for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment are warranted
   to improve the cost-effectiveness and control of this cancer.},

Title = {Turning the Analysis of Obesity-Mortality Associations Upside Down:
   Modeling Years of Life Lost Through Conditional Distributions},

Abstract = {Objective: We demonstrate the utility of parametric survival analysis.
   The analysis of longevity as a function of risk factors such as body
   mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)), activity levels, and dietary factors is a
   mainstay of obesity research. Modeling survival through hazard
   functions, relative risks, or odds of dying with methods such as Cox
   proportional hazards or logistic regression are the most common
   approaches and have many advantages. However, they also have
   disadvantages in terms of the ease of interpretability, especially for
   non-statisticians; the need for additional data to convert parameter
   estimates to estimates of years of life lost (YLL); debates about the
   appropriate time scale in the model; and an inability to estimate median
   survival time when the censoring rate is too high.
   Design and Methods: We will conduct parametric survival analyses with
   multiple distributions, including distributions that are known to be
   poor fits (Gaussian), as well as a newly discovered ``Compressed
   Gaussian'' distribution.
   Results: Parametric survival analysis models were able to accurately
   estimate median survival times in a population-based data set of 15,703
   individuals, even for distributions that were not good fits and the
   censoring rate was high, due to the central limit theorem.
   Conclusions: Parametric survival models are able to provide more direct
   answers, and in our analysis of an obesity-related data set, gave
   consistent YLL estimates regardless of the distribution used. We
   recommend increased consideration of parametric survival models in
   chronic disease and risk factor epidemiology.},

Title = {Years of life lost due to colorectal cancer in Poland between 2000 and
   2014 according to voivodships},
Journal = {FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE REVIEW},

Pages = {245-249},
Abstract = {Background. Colorectal cancers (CRCs) are among the most important
   oncological causes of death in Europe. Poland belongs to countries where
   the mortality rates due to this cause exceed the average values for
   EU-28.
   Objectives. Comparison of the number of years of life lost (YLLs) due to
   CRC between 2000 and 2014 in Poland by voivodships.
   Material and methods. The study was based on a dataset containing
   information from the death certificates of Poles who died in 2000 and
   2014 (368,028 and 376,467 records, respectively). The data on deaths
   caused by CRC (C18-C21 according to ICD-10) was used for the analysis
   (8,517 deaths in 2000 and 11,411 deaths in 2014). SEYLL (Standard
   Expected Years of Life Lost) was implemented to assess YLLs.
   Results. In 2000, the highest number of YLLs per 10,000 men was recorded
   in Zachodniopomorskie (55.7 years), and in 2014 - in Opolskie (77.5
   years). The increasing tendency of this measure between 2000 and 2014 in
   the group of men was observed in all voivodships. In the group of women,
   in 2000 the highest number of YLLs per 10,000 was reported in Lodzkie
   (46 years), and in 2014-in Warminsko-Mazurskie (49.6 years). In women,
   an SEYLL, decline over time was noted only in Lodzkie and Dolnoslaskie,
   and in other voivodships, its values increased.
   Conclusions. Between 2000 and 2014, an upward tendency of YLLs due to
   CRC was observed in Poland, though with territorial differentiation. It
   is advisable to search for more effective methods of reducing existing
   inequalities between individual provinces of Poland.},

Abstract = {Background. The number of years of life lost (YLL) in a population
   depends not only on the number of deaths but also on the age at which
   the deaths have occurred, and, as a measure of the burden of premature
   mortality, is an important piece of information for public health
   professionals.
   Methods. We calculated YLL in the population of Friuli Venezia Giulia, a
   1 200 000 inhabitant Italian region, in 2013 and the trend in the past
   14 years, through a population-based study using the regional mortality
   database as the source of information. The same projected life
   expectancy estimates for 2050 were used for calculating YLL both in
   males and females, for each calendar year.
   Results. In 2013, we counted 14 080 deaths and estimated 220 961 YLL.
   Malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases accounted for the
   greatest number of YLL. Injuries had the highest number of YLL per
   death. Overall, YLL decreased from 2000 to 2013, but differences were
   observed for different causes of death. Cancers, cardiovascular
   diseases, and unintentional injuries showed a decreasing trend, whereas
   infectious diseases resulted increasing over time.
   Conclusion. This study, estimating the relative impact of different
   conditions on the society though the YLL, is a relevant input for the
   regional public health agenda.},

Abstract = {Temperature has been associated with population health, but few studies
   have projected the future temperature-related years of life lost
   attributable to climate change. To project future temperature related
   disease burden in Tianjin, we selected years of life lost (YLL) as the
   dependent variable to explore YLL attributable to climate change. A
   generalized linear model (GLM) and distributed lag non-linear model were
   combined to assess the non-linear and delayed effects of temperature on
   the YLL of non-accidental mortality. Then, we calculated the YLL changes
   attributable to future climate scenarios in 2055 and 2090. The
   relationships of daily mean temperature with the YLL of non-accident
   mortality were basically U-shaped. Both the daily mean temperature
   increase on high-temperature days and its drop on low-temperature days
   caused an increase of YLL and non-accidental deaths. The
   temperature-related YLL will worsen if future climate change exceeds 2
   degrees C. In addition, the adverse effects of extreme temperature on
   YLL occurred more quickly than that of the overall temperature. The
   impact of low temperature was greater than that of high temperature. Men
   were vulnerable to high temperature compared with women. This analysis
   highlights that the government should formulate environmental policies
   to reach the Paris Agreement goal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Background: Excess body weight has become a major public health problem
   worldwide, and the burden of overweight and obesity was calculated in
   this work from a health economics perspective.
   Objective: To estimate the burden of disease attributable to overweight
   and obesity among males and females aged 20 years and older using years
   of life lost (YLL) and age-standardized YLL rates (ASYLL), and to rank
   the leading causes of premature death.
   Design: A cross-sectional study took place (2010-2014) and 6,054 deaths
   were analyzed. Thirteen basic causes of death associated with overweight
   or obesity were included. The population attributable fraction (PAF),
   YLL, and ASYLL were calculated.
   Results: The overall burden attributable to overweight and obesity was
   36,087 YLL, and the estimated ASYLL per 10,000 persons was 1,098 and
   1,029 in males and females, respectively. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was
   the main cause of premature death (males, 968 ASYLL; females, 772
   ASYLL).
   Conclusions: Overweight and obesity are major risk factors of chronic
   diseases that are main causes of premature death in the study
   population. Strategies for preventing overweight and obesity may
   decrease the incidence and mortality associated with these
   non-communicable diseases. ASYLL seems to be an indicator that is
   particularly well adapted to decision-making in public health.},

   Setting: All 459 local authority districts (England and Wales) and local
   government districts (Scotland).
   Participants: Estimated population and registered deaths aged 0-64.
   Main outcome measures: Indirectly standardised mortality ratios for all
   cause mortality; percentages of deaths that would be avoided if there
   were no inequalities between and within regions.
   Results: The decrease in premature mortality of 36\% seen in Great
   Britain ranged from 42\% in Wales to 33\% in Scotland and 31\% in
   London. Differences between regions led to excess mortality of about
   25\% in Scotland, the North East, and the North West. In London excess
   mortality increased from 14\% to 19\%. Inequalities within regions
   increased in most parts of Great Britain, the exceptions being Wales,
   London, and the South West. The largest increase was seen in Scotland
   where the percentage of excess deaths increased from 23\% to 33\%.
   Conclusions: A decrease in premature mortality in Great Britain was seen
   in all regions, although less pronounced in London, but the gap between
   regions remained. Inequalities between districts within regions vary
   from one region to another and have increased in nearly every part of
   Great Britain.},

Abstract = {It has been established that eminent creative writers tend to die
   younger than their counterparts in other creative-achievement domains.
   The present study replicates these findings using a data set of 2102
   eminent historical subjects from seven different disciplines, and
   reviews three extant explanations for this phenomenon. Each explanation
   was tested using an indicator of versatility. None of the life-span
   hypotheses extended from each explanation to the interaction of
   achievement domain x versatility was supported. In particular, no models
   were able to account for the precipitous decrease (2.7 to 8.6 years) in
   the life spans of versatile scientists when compared to nonversatile
   scientists. Consequently, a new explanatory model was proposed that
   draws on psychopathology, vocation choice, and personality
   characteristics as factors underlying the apparent differences in life
   span across achievement domains and versatility.},

Title = {Association Between Lifetime Affective Symptoms and Premature Mortality},
Journal = {JAMA PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Number = {8},
Pages = {806-813},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Key PointsQuestionHow are affective symptoms over the life course
   associated with mortality? FindingsIn a British birth cohort (n=3001),
   affective symptoms were assessed between adolescence and age 53 years.
   Those who had case-level affective symptoms 1, 2, and 3 to 4 times had
   76\%, 87\%, and 134\% higher rates of premature mortality, respectively,
   by age 68 years compared with those who never experienced case-level
   symptoms; associations were largely explained by factors in adulthood,
   such as self-reported health conditions, smoking, and physical activity.
   MeaningFuture research into causal pathways and potential points of
   intervention for premature mortality should consider affective symptom
   history.
   ImportanceAssociations between affective symptoms and mortality have
   been evaluated, but studies have not examined timing or cumulative
   exposure to affective symptoms over the life course. ObjectivesTo
   examine how lifetime accumulation and timing of affective symptoms are
   associated with mortality and identify potential explanatory factors.
   Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData were obtained from the MRC
   National Survey of Health and Development (1946 British birth cohort), a
   socially stratified, population-based sample originally consisting of
   5362 singleton births in England, Wales, and Scotland during March 1946.
   The cohort has been followed up 24 times, most recently in 2014-2015.
   Eligible participants included those flagged for mortality with
   affective symptom data available at a minimum of 3 time points (n=3001).
   Data analysis was conducted from July 2016 to January 2019.
   ExposuresAffective symptoms were assessed at ages 13 to 15 years
   (teacher-rated questionnaire), 36 years (Present State Examination
   clinical semistructured interview), 43 years (Psychiatric Symptom
   Frequency questionnaire), and 53 years (General Health
   Questionnaire-28). Case-level affective symptoms were determined by
   those scoring in the top 16th percentile (ie, suggestive of a clinical
   diagnosis). Main Outcomes and MeasuresMortality data were obtained from
   the UK National Health Service Central Register from age 53 to 68 years.
   ResultsOf 3001 study members (1509 {[}50.3\%] female, 1492 {[}49.7\%]
   male), 235 individuals (7.8\%) died over a 15-year follow-up. After
   adjustment for sex, those who experienced case-level affective symptoms
   1, 2, and 3 to 4 times had 76\%, 87\%, and 134\% higher rates of
   premature mortality, respectively, compared with those who never
   experienced case-level symptoms. Case-level symptoms in adolescence only
   (ages 13-15 years) were associated with a 94\% increased rate of
   mortality, which was unexplained after full adjustment for covariates
   (hazard ratio, 1.73; 95\% CI, 1.10-2.72). Associations between
   participants with case-level symptoms multiple (2-4) times and mortality
   were predominately explained by adult health indicators and behaviors.
   For example, associations for those with case-level symptoms 3 to 4
   times were most strongly attenuated by number of health conditions
   (32.1\%), anxiolytic use (28.4\%), lung function (24.6\%), physical
   activity (23.9\%), smoking (24.6\%), antidepressant use (20.1\%), diet
   (16.4\%), pulse rate (12.7\%), and adult social class (11.2\%).
   Conclusions and RelevanceLifetime accumulation of affective symptoms may
   be associated with an increased rate of mortality, with explanatory
   pathways dependent on the duration and timing of symptoms. Future
   research into causal pathways and potential points of intervention
   should consider affective symptom history.
   This cohort study examines mortality in individuals with varying levels
   of affective symptoms occurring over 15 years.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This study explores whether there is a short-term relationship between
   intragenerational social mobility and mortality while individuals are
   working and whether it is widespread across different causes of death.
   Net of accumulated advantages and disadvantages, social mobility may
   influence mortality through health selection or changes in well-being.
   Men and women working in 1996 up to age 65 are observed annually until
   2012 in Swedish register data. Time-varying covariates and origin and
   destination status are controlled for in discrete time event-history
   analyses. Results show that when men were upwardly mobile, mortality was
   lower due to cancer, CVD, IHD, and suicide. Upward mobility was only
   associated with lower odds of suicide for women. When downwardly mobile,
   cancer mortality was higher for both men and women and smoking-related
   cancer mortality was higher for men. Social mobility was not linked to
   deaths related to accidents and poisoning or alcohol-related mortality.
   The results may support a relationship between social mobility and
   mortality characterized by health selection: Only in the case of a
   chronic illness (cancer) was downward mobility associated with higher
   mortality. The widespread relationship between upward mobility and lower
   mortality for men may also indicate positive health selection into
   attaining a higher class and that individuals with poor health may be
   less likely to search for better positions or receive promotions.},

Title = {Regional inequalities in premature mortality in Great Britain},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Premature mortality exhibits strong spatial patterns in Great Britain.
   Local authorities that are located further North and West, that are more
   distant from its political centre London and that are more urban tend to
   have a higher premature mortality rate. Premature mortality also tends
   to cluster among geographically contiguous and proximate local
   authorities. We develop a novel analytical research design that relies
   on spatial pattern recognition to demonstrate that an empirical model
   that contains only socio-economic variables can eliminate these spatial
   patterns almost entirely. We demonstrate that socioeconomic factors
   across local authority districts explain 81 percent of variation in
   female and 86 percent of variation in male premature mortality in
   2012-14. As our findings suggest, policy-makers cannot hope that health
   policies alone suffice to significantly reduce inequalities in health.
   Rather, it requires strong efforts to reduce the inequalities in
   socio-economic factors, or living conditions for short, in order to
   overcome the spatial disparities in health, of which premature mortality
   is a clear indication.},

Title = {Premature mortality among males with substance use disorders},

Abstract = {Objective: Previous studies have demonstrated that substance use
   disorders (SUD) are associated with premature mortality in clinical
   populations, though findings regarding the effect of antisocial
   personality disorder (ASP) on mortality among persons with SUD are less
   clear. However, it is unclear to what extent that finding generalizes to
   persons with SUD in the community, because very little work has been
   done involving mortality in longitudinal studies of mortality associated
   with SUD. The objective of this study was to assess whether the presence
   of SUD or ASP is associated with early mortality among males (fathers)
   in a predominantly community sample, using a 15-year prospective
   longitudinal study design.
   Method: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of adolescents and
   their fathers. The adolescent subjects were recruited at age 10-12
   years, with follow-up evaluations at ages 14, 16, 19, 22, and 25.
   Questions were asked about paternal mortality during each of those
   visits. The study sample for this study was the 769 fathers of the
   adolescent subjects, who included N= 341 fathers with a DSM-III-R
   diagnosis of SUD and N=428 control fathers without a SUD. 89\% of these
   fathers were recruited from the community, and 11\% were recruited from
   clinical sources. Comorbidity patterns were described. A multivariate
   Cox regression analysis was performed with the father's age at death or
   last assessment as the dependent variable, and education, SUD, and ASP
   as the independent variables.
   Results: Lower education level, the presence of a substance use
   disorder, and the presence of antisocial personality disorder were
   significantly associated with earlier mortality (Wald=5.1, df=1,
   p=0.024; Wald=5.1, df=1, p=0.024, and Wald= 5.5, df= 1, p=0.019,
   respectively). Most subjects died from medical illnesses, as opposed to
   drug overdoses or accidents, which is different from the pattern often
   noted in clinical samples.
   Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that the presence of
   SUD, the presence of ASP, and a lower education level were associated
   with early mortality in our primarily community-based sample, which
   extends previous reports of similar findings in clinical samples. The
   magnitude of the prematurity of the deaths was less that that generally
   noted in previous studies involving clinical samples, and the causes of
   death were also somewhat different from those noted in clinical samples.
   The majority of cases of mortality in our SUD sample resulted from
   medical illnesses rather than from accidents or overdoses. (c) 2007

Abstract = {This study focuses on male family situation and premature mortality. For
   a total of 682,919 men, we analysed mortality from different causes
   (1991-2000) among lone fathers, with and without custody of their
   children, and among childless men, with and without partners. Long-term
   cohabiting fathers with a child in their household were used as
   comparison group. We employed data from Swedish censuses, national
   health-data registers, and a Swedish register containing information
   about known biological relations between children and parents. We
   investigated the extent to which different kinds of relations were
   influenced by varying socioeconomic circumstances between groups, and
   also processes of health selection. The results suggest that lone
   non-custodial fathers and lone childless men face the greatest increase
   in risks, especially from injury and addiction, and also from all-cause
   mortality and ischaemic heart disease. Being a lone custodial father
   also entails increased risk, although generally to a much lesser extent,
   and not for all outcomes. The elevated risks found in all the subgroups
   considered diminished substantially when proxy variables to control for
   health-selection effects and socioeconomic circumstances were added to
   the initial model. Risks fell most in response to introduction of the
   socioeconomic variables, but health selection also played a major role,
   mostly in the cases of lone non-custodial fathers and lone childless
   men. However, even following these adjustments, significant risk
   increases, although greatly attenuated, remained for all the subgroups.

Abstract = {Premature mortality is an important public health indicator with
   ramifications to social and economic outcomes. The purpose of this study
   is to examine whether premature mortality, measured by the years of
   potential life lost (YPLL), converges among the U.S. states and which
   mortality components lead to divergence. To this end, we calculate the
   YPLL and apply the Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009) convergence test
   methodology. We find that for males and blacks all U.S. states converge
   to a steady-state while for females, whites and total population, the
   states form convergence clubs. These clubs differ mainly due to
   variances in infant, cardiovascular and unintentional injury mortalities
   with the ones with the lesser YPLL located mainly on the west and east
   coast.},

Abstract = {Alcohol consumption is the third major risk factor for the ``ill
   health{''} in EU, after tobacco and blood pressure, accounting of 7.2\%
   of the total burden of diseases (12\% in males and 2\% in females). The
   aim of this study is to underline the effects of alcohol drinking on the
   Romanians' health, in order to mobilize the national stakeholders for
   developing a long-term cross-sectoral strategy on alcohol control.
   A descriptive approach was done based on regular data from national and
   international public databases. The effect of alcohol drinking on health
   status was evaluated through alcohol consumption (no. of pure alcohol
   liters per capita and per year and prevalence of alcohol drinkers) and
   alcohol attributable mortality measured as number of deaths and as
   number of potential years of life lost. Alcohol consumption has an
   important impact on the health status of the Romanian population in
   terms of number of deaths and of years of life lost, accounting around
   20000 deaths in 2002 and 12 years of life lost per each death. Synergic
   measures are required to control this problem, in line with the EU
   strategy, but taking into consideration the national context.},

Abstract = {To assess YLL and mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient
   temperature, we collected mortality and environmental data from June 1,
   2012 to December 30, 2017 in Shenzhen. We applied distributed lag
   nonlinear models with 21 days of lag to examine temperature-YLL and
   temperature-mortality associations, and calculated the attributable
   fractions of YLL and deaths for non-optimum temperature, including four
   subranges, mild cold, mild heat, extreme cold, and extreme heat. Cold
   and heat were distinguished by the optimum temperature, and each was
   separated into extreme and mild by cutoffs at 2.5th (12.2 degrees C) and
   97.5th (30.4 degrees C) temperature percentile further. The optimum
   temperature was defined as the temperature that had minimum effect on
   YLL or mortality risk. The optimum temperature for non-accidental YLL
   was 24.5 degrees C, and for mortality it was 25.4 degrees C. Except for
   the population older than 65 years, the optimum temperature was
   generally lower in the YLL model than the mortality model. Of the total
   61,576 non-accidental deaths and 1,350,835.7 YLL within the study
   period, 17.28\% (95\% empirical CI 9.42-25.14\%) of YLL and 17.27\%
   (12.70-21.34\%) of mortality were attributable to non-optimum
   temperature. More YLL was caused by cold (10.14\%, 3.94-16.36\%) than by
   heat (7.14\%, 0.47-13.88\%). Mild cold (12.2-24.5 degrees C) was
   responsible for far more YLL (8.78\%, 3.00-14.61\%) than extreme cold
   (3.5-12.2 degrees C). As for cardiovascular deaths, only the fractions
   attributable to overall and cold temperature were significant, with mild
   cold contributing the largest fraction to YLL (16.31\%, 6.85-25.82\%)
   and mortality (16.08\%, 9.77-21.22\%). Most of the temperature-related
   YLL and mortality was attributable to mild but non-optimum weather,
   especially mild cold, while the YLL model implied a more prominent heat
   effect on premature death. Our findings can supply additional evidence
   from multiperspectives for health planners to define priorities and make
   targeted policies for mitigating the burden of adverse temperatures.},

Abstract = {The road traffic crash burden is significant in Brazil; calculating
   years of life lost and life expectancy reduction quantifies the burden
   of road traffic deaths to enable prioritization of this issue. Years of
   life lost and reduction in life expectancy were calculated using 2008
   population/crash data from Brazil's ministries of health and transport.
   The potential for reduction in crash mortality was calculated for
   hypothetical scenarios reducing death rates to those of the
   best-performing region and age category. In Brazil, road traffic deaths
   reduce the at-birth life expectancy by 0.8 years for males and by 0.2
   years for females. Many years of life lost for men and woman could be
   averted-270,733 and 123,986, respectively-if all rates matched those of
   the lowest-risk region and age category. This study further
   characterizes the burden of motor vehicle deaths in Brazil and
   quantifies the potential health benefits of policies/interventions that
   reduce road traffic death rates to those of the best-performing
   subpopulations.},

Abstract = {Legal intervention is a powerful tool to reduce road traffic injuries
   (RTIs). China amended the Road Traffic Safety Law in 2011, but the
   impact of amended law on traffic crash deaths is still unknown. In this
   study, we conducted an interrupted time series analysis and examined
   years of life lost (YLLs) per 100,000 population as the assessment
   indicator to evaluate the association of road traffic safety law and
   traffic crash mortality. Annual YLLs data due to traffic deaths from
   2002 to 2019 in China were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease
   (GBD) 2019. After implementation of the revised law, the average level
   of total YLLs per 100,000 population due to traffic deaths decreased
   from 1133.14 to 848.87, and the slope of annual YLLs per 100,000
   population decreased by 30.11 (95\% CI: 22.46, 37.75), indicating a
   steeper downward trend. The revised traffic law was associated with YLLs
   reduction due to traffic deaths for males, females, all age groups,
   pedestrians, motor vehicle users, and other road users, as well as
   traffic deaths attributed to alcohol use and tobacco use. These findings
   suggested that the revised Road Traffic Safety Law improved road safety
   by decreasing YLLs due to traffic deaths in China. However, the burden
   of RTIs is still heavy and efforts to further improve traffic laws and
   the adoption of other interventions are urgently needed.},

Title = {Modeling Obesity in Norway (The MOON Study): A Decision-Analytic
   Approach-Prevalence, Costs, and Years of Life Lost},
Journal = {MEDICAL DECISION MAKING},

Abstract = {Background
   Limited knowledge exists on the expected long-term effects and
   cost-effectiveness of initiatives aiming to reduce the burden of
   obesity.
   Aim
   To develop a Norwegian obesity-focused disease-simulation model: the
   MOON model.
   Material and Methods
   We developed a Markov model and simulated a Norwegian birth cohort's
   movement between the health states ``normal
   weight,{''}{''}overweight,{''}{''}obese 1,{''}{''}obese 2,{''} and
   ``dead{''} using a lifetime perspective. Model input was estimated using
   longitudinal data from health surveys and real-world data (RWD) from
   local and national registers (N = 99,348). The model is deterministic
   and probabilistic and stratified by gender. Model validity was assessed
   by estimating the cohort's expected prevalence, health care costs, and
   mortality related to overweight and obesity.
   Results
   Throughout the cohort's life, the prevalence of overweight increased
   steadily and stabilized at 45\% at 45 y of age. The number of obese 1
   and 2 individuals peaked at age 75 y, when 44\% of women and 35\% of men
   were obese. The incremental costs per person associated with obesity was
   highest in older ages and, when accumulated over the lifetime, higher
   among women (euro12,118, euro9,495-euro15,047) than men (euro6,646,
   euro5,252-euro10,900). On average, obesity shortened the life expectancy
   of women/men in the whole cohort by 1.31/1.08 y. The life expectancy for
   normal-weight women/men at age 30 was 83.31/80.31. The life expectancy
   was reduced by 1.05/0.65 y if the individual was overweight, obese
   (2.87/2.71 y), or obese 2 (4.06/4.83 y).
   Conclusion
   The high expected prevalence of obesity in the future will lead to
   substantial health care costs and large losses in life-years. This
   underscores the need to implement interventions to reduce the burden of
   obesity; the MOON model will enable economic evaluations for a wide
   range of interventions.},

Abstract = {This paper quantifies the net impact (direct and indirect effects) of
   the pandemic on the United States population in 2020 using three
   metrics: excess deaths, life expectancy, and total years of life lost.
   The findings indicate there were 375,235 excess deaths, with 83\%
   attributable to direct, and 17\% attributable to indirect effects of
   COVID-19. The decrease in life expectancy was 1.67 years, translating to
   a reversion of 14 years in historical life expectancy gains. Total years
   of life lost in 2020 was 7,362,555 across the USA (73\% directly
   attributable, 27\% indirectly attributable to COVID-19), with
   considerable heterogeneity at the individual state level.},

Year = {2004},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives: Standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) is a component
   of the disability adjusted life year (DALY) measure of disease burden.
   SEYLL is calculated from the expected remaining years, as specified by a
   normative survivorship that is derived from a model life table. Because
   every death has non-zero remaining years, years of life lost are never
   zero, even in a population that achieves the ideal life expectancy of
   the model life table itself. As zero is unattainable, what is an
   acceptable years of life lost? The study calculates norms and examines
   NZ data against them.
   Method: Using model life tables with expectancy 80 years for men and
   82.5 years for women, the years of life lost in cohorts that achieve the
   model life table expectancy are evaluated. Years of life lost per death
   and per head of population are considered and the effects of
   age-standardising, discounting and age-weighting are evaluated.
   Mortality and Census data are used to compute actual years of life lost
   in New Zealand, which are compared with the norms.
   Results: Crude years of life lost per death is about 9-10 years in a
   population that achieves the model life table distribution. New Zealand
   European years of life lost are about five years in excess of the 9-10
   year norm; Maori about 21 years. The effects of age standardising, using
   the Segi standard population, give a norm of about 21 years; both Maori
   and European values are about two years in excess of this figure.
   Conclusions: Crude and age-standardised YLLs in New Zealand exceed the
   ideal set by the model life tables norms, especially so in Maori.
   Age-standardising has a strong influence on the statistics.
   Implications: Years of life lost measures need to be considered against
   the established norms. Unless done so, the measures can appear more
   adverse than they actually are.},

Title = {Years of life lost due to traumatic brain injury in Europe: A
   cross-sectional analysis of 16 countries},
Journal = {PLOS MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a major public health, medical, and
   societal challenge globally. They present a substantial burden to
   victims, their families, and the society as a whole. Although indicators
   such as incidence or death rates provide insight into the occurrence and
   outcome of TBIs in various populations, they fail to quantify the full
   extent of their public health and societal impact. Measures such as
   years of life lost (YLLs), which quantifies the number of years of life
   lost because the person dies prematurely due to a disease or injury,
   should be employed to better quantify the population impact. The aim of
   this study was to provide an in-depth analysis of the burden of deaths
   due to TBI by calculating TBI-specific YLLs in 16 European countries,
   analyzing their main causes and demographic patterns, using data
   extracted from death certificates under unified guidelines and collected
   in a standardized manner.
   Methods and findings
   A population-wide, cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted
   in 16 European countries to estimate TBI YLLs for the year 2013. The
   data used for all analyses in this study were acquired from the
   statistical office of the European Union (Eurostat). A specifically
   tailored dataset of micro-level data was provided that listed the
   external cause of death (International Classification of Diseases-10th
   Revision {[}ICD-10] codes V01-Y98), the specific nature of injury
   (ICD-10 codes S00-T98), the age at death, and sex for each death.
   Overall number of TBI YLLs, crude and age-standardized TBI YLL rates,
   and TBI YLLs per case were calculated stratified for country, sex, and
   age. Pooled analyses were performed in order to estimate summary
   age-standardized rates of TBI YLLs. In order to evaluate the relative
   importance of TBI in the context of all injuries, proportions of TBI
   YLLs out of overall injury YLLs were calculated. The total number of TBI
   YLLs was estimated by extrapolating the pooled crude rate of TBI YLLs in
   the 16 analyzed countries to the total population of the 28 member
   states of the EU (EU-28). We found that a total of 17,049 TBI deaths
   occurred in 2013 in the 16 analyzed countries. These translated into a
   total of 374,636 YLLs. The pooled age-standardized rate of YLLs per
   100,000 people per year was 259.1 (95\% CI: 205.8 to 312.3) overall,
   427.5 (95\% CI: 290.0 to 564.9) in males, and 105.4 (95\% CI: 89.1 to
   121.6) in females. Males contributed substantially more to TBI YLLs than
   females (282,870 YLLs, 76\% of all TBI YLLs), which translated into a
   rate ratio of 3.24 (95\% CI: 3.22 to 3.27). Each TBI death was on
   average associated with 24.3 (95\% CI: 22.0 to 26.6) YLLs overall, 25.6
   (95\% CI: 23.4 to 27.8) in males and 20.9 (17.9 to 24.0) in females.
   Falls and traffic crashes were the most common external causes of TBI
   YLLs. TBI contributed on average 41\% (44\% in males and 34\% in
   females) to overall injury YLLs. Extrapolating our findings, about 1.3
   million YLLs were attributable to TBI in the EU-28 in 2013 overall, 1.1
   million in males and 271,000 in females. This study is based on
   administratively collected data from 16 countries, and despite the
   efforts to harmonize them to the greatest possible extent, there may be
   differences in coding practices or reporting between countries. If
   present, these would be inherited into our findings without our ability
   to control for them. The extrapolation of the pooled rates from the 16
   countries to the EU-28 should be interpreted with caution.
   Conclusions
   Our study showed that TBI-related deaths and YLLs have a substantial
   impact at the individual and population level in Europe and present an
   important societal and economic burden that must not be overlooked. We
   provide information valuable for policy-makers, enabling them to
   evaluate and plan preventive activities and resource allocation, and to
   formulate and implement strategic decisions. In addition, our results
   can serve as a basis for analyzing the overall burden of TBI in the
   population.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background. The pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   has forced governments to implement strict social mitigation strategies
   to reduce the morbidity and mortality from acute infections. These
   strategies, however, carry a significant risk for mental health, which
   can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality and is
   currently not included in modeling the impact of the pandemic. Methods.
   We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure, applied to
   Switzerland as an example. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol
   use disorder, childhood trauma due to domestic violence, changes in
   marital status, and social isolation, as these are known to increase YLL
   in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of
   movement. We stipulated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months
   based on current public health plans. Results. The study projects that
   the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial
   consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be
   entirely borne by 2.1\% of the population, who will suffer an average of
   9.79 YLL. Conclusions. The results presented here are likely to
   underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL.
   However, they highlight the need for public health models to expand
   their scope in order to provide better estimates of the risks and
   benefits of mitigation.},

Abstract = {The impact of influenza pandemics might be overestimated; the published
   studies of years of life lost (YLL) have typically ignored the presence
   of underlying chronic conditions or health risk behaviors in most
   deaths. We used data on deaths involving laboratory-confirmed 2009
   influenza A(H1N1) virus infection that occurred between April 2009 and
   May 2010 in Hong Kong, China, to adjust for these underlying risk
   factors. Life expectancy was corrected with hazard-based modifications
   to the life tables. The excess hazards posed by underlying risk factors
   were added to the baseline age-specific hazards in the local life tables
   to reflect the life expectancy associated with each underlying risk
   factor. Of 72 deceased persons with laboratory-confirmed 2009 influenza
   A(H1N1) virus infection, 56 had underlying risk factors. We estimated
   that the 2009 pandemic was associated with 1,540 (95 confidence
   interval: 1,350, 1,630) YLL after adjustment for age and underlying risk
   factors. This figureis approximately 25 lower than the YLL estimate of
   2,080 derived after adjustment for age but not for risk factors. Our
   analysis demonstrates the potential scale of bias in YLL estimation if
   underlying risk factors are ignored. The estimation of YLL with
   correction for underlying risk factors in addition to age could also
   provide a framework for similar calculations elsewhere.},

Abstract = {The relative importance of cancer of the cervix among several important
   causes of mortality (from cancer and other diseases) has been evaluated
   by estimating the years of life lost (YLL) by young and middle-aged
   women (25-64 years old) in different regions of the world. The life
   years were weighted to reflect their importance to the individual and to
   society. On a global basis, cancer of the cervix is responsible for
   about 2\% of the total (weighted) YLL, fewer than for other causes of
   mortality in this age group. However, it is the most important cause of
   YLL in Latin America and the Caribbean. It also makes the largest
   contribution to YLL from cancer in the populous regions of SubSaharan
   Africa and South-Central Asia where the actual risk of loss of life from
   this cause is higher, although overshadowed by noncancer deaths (from
   AIDS, TB and maternal conditions). The overall picture is not very
   sensitive to the age weighting function used. The fact that most of the
   loss of life is preventable, and that simple technologies have been
   developed that make this practicable, means that cervical cancer has an
   even higher profile from the perspective of resource allocation in low
   income settings. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Short-term effects of ambient nitrogen dioxide on years of life lost in
   48 major Chinese cities, 2013-2017},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {263},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence on the acute effect of short-term exposure to
   nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on years of life lost (YLL) is rare, especially
   in multicity setting.
   Methods: We conducted a time series study among 48 major Chinese cities
   covering more than 403 million people from 2013 to 2017. The relative
   percentage changes of NO2-YLL were estimated by generalized additive
   models in each city, then were pooled to generate average effects using
   random-effect models. In addition, stratified analyses by individual
   demographic factors and temperature as well as meta-regression analyses
   incorporating city-specific air pollutant concentrations, meteorological
   conditions, and socioeconomic indicators were performed to explore
   potential effect modification.
   Results: A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in two-day moving average (lag01) NO2
   concentration was associated with 0.64\% (95\% CI: 0.47\%, 0.81\%),
   0.47\% (95\% CI: 0.27\%, 0.68\%), and 0.68\% (95\% CI: 0.34\%, 1.02\%)
   relative increments in YLL due to nonaccidental causes, cardiovascular
   diseases (CVD), and respiratory diseases (RD), respectively. These
   associations were generally robust to the adjustment of co-pollutants,
   except for NO2-CVD that might be confounded by fine particulate matter.
   The increased YLL induced by NO2 were more pronounced in elderly people,
   hotter days, and cities characterized by less severe air pollution or
   higher temperature.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrated robust evidence on the

Abstract = {Following Kanbur and Mukherjee (Bull Econ Res 59(4):339-359 2007), a
   solution to the ``missing poor{''} problem (i.e., selection bias in
   poverty measures due to income-differentiated mortality) consists in
   computing hypothetical poverty rates while assigning a fictitious income
   to the prematurely dead. However, in a dynamic general equilibrium
   economy, doing ``as if{''} the prematurely dead were still alive is
   likely to affect wages, output and capital accumulation, with an
   uncertain effect on poverty. We develop a three-period OLG model with
   income-differentiated mortality and compare actual poverty rates with
   hypothetical poverty rates that would have prevailed if everyone faced
   the survival conditions of the top income class. Including the
   prematurely dead has an ambiguous impact on poverty, since it affects
   income distribution through capital dilution, composition effects, and
   horizon effects. Our results are illustrated by quantifying the impact
   of income-differentiated mortality on poverty measures for France
   (1820-2010).},

Title = {Application of a Modified Garbage Code Algorithm to Estimate

Abstract = {Years of life lost (YLLs) are estimated based on mortality and cause of
   death (CoD); therefore, it is necessary to accurately calculate CoD to
   estimate the burden of disease. The garbage code algorithm was developed
   by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to redistribute inaccurate
   CoD and enhance the validity of CoD estimation. This study aimed to
   estimate cause-specific mortality rates and YLLs in Korea by applying a
   modified garbage code algorithm. CoD data for 2010-2012 were used to
   calculate the number of deaths. The garbage code algorithm was then
   applied to calculate target cause (i.e., valid CoD) and adjusted CoD
   using the garbage code redistribution. The results showed that garbage
   code deaths accounted for approximately 25\% of all CoD during
   2010-2012. In 2012, lung cancer contributed the most to cause-specific
   death according to the Statistics Korea. However, when CoD was adjusted
   using the garbage code redistribution, ischemic heart disease was the
   most common CoD. Furthermore, before garbage code redistribution,
   self-harm contributed the most YLLs followed by lung cancer and liver
   cancer; however, after application of the garbage code redistribution,
   though self-harm was the most common leading cause of YLL, it is
   followed by ischemic heart disease and lung cancer. Our results showed
   that garbage code deaths accounted for a substantial amount of mortality
   and YLLs. The results may enhance our knowledge of burden of disease and
   help prioritize intervention settings by changing the relative
   importance of burden of disease.},

Title = {Particulate Matter and Premature Mortality: A Bayesian Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: We present a systematic review of studies assessing the
   association between ambient particulate matter (PM) and premature
   mortality and the results of a Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis while
   accounting for population differences of the included studies. Methods:
   The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO systematic review
   registry. Medline, CINAHL and Global Health databases were
   systematically searched. Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis was
   conducted using a non-informative prior to assess whether the regression
   coefficients differed across observations due to the heterogeneity among
   studies. Results: We identified 3248 records for title and abstract
   review, of which 309 underwent full text screening. Thirty-six studies
   were included, based on the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were
   from China (n = 14), India (n = 6) and the USA (n = 3). PM2.5 was the
   most frequently reported pollutant. PM was estimated using modelling
   techniques (22 studies), satellite-based measures (four studies) and
   direct measurements (ten studies). Mortality data were sourced from
   country-specific mortality statistics for 17 studies, Global Burden of
   Disease data for 16 studies, WHO data for two studies and life tables
   for one study. Sixteen studies were included in the Bayesian
   hierarchical meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that the annual
   estimate of premature mortality attributed to PM2.5 was 253 per
   1,000,000 population (95\% CI: 90, 643) and 587 per 1,000,000 population
   (95\% CI: 1, 39,746) for PM10. Conclusion: 253 premature deaths per
   million population are associated with exposure to ambient PM2.5. We
   observed an unstable estimate for PM10, most likely due to heterogeneity
   among the studies. Future research efforts should focus on the effects
   of ambient PM10 and premature mortality, as well as include populations
   outside Asia. Key messages: Ambient PM2.5 is associated with premature
   mortality. Given that rapid urbanization may increase this burden in the
   coming decades, our study highlights the urgency of implementing air
   pollution mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to population and
   planetary health.},

Abstract = {Purpose Rural communities often experience higher rates of mortality
   than their urban counterparts, with gaps widening in the foreseeable
   future. However, the underlying level of socioeconomic vulnerability
   (area deprivation) among rural communities can vary widely. This study
   examines rural-urban differences in mortality-related outcomes within
   comparable levels of deprivation. Methods Rural-urban differences in
   Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL), derived from the County Health
   Rankings, were examined across comparable levels of area deprivation
   using a quantile regression approach. Rural-urban differences in YPLL
   were estimated at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles
   across levels of deprivation. Findings Compared to the reference
   population (urban counties/least deprived) a clear increase in YPLL
   among both rural and urban counties was noted across levels of
   deprivation, with the highest level of YPLL occurring in counties with
   the most deprivation. While YPLL increased across levels of deprivation,
   the magnitude of these differences was markedly higher in rural counties
   compared to urban, particularly among the most deprived counties. Rural
   counties experienced an advantage at the lowest percentiles and levels
   of deprivation. However, this advantage quickly deteriorated, revealing
   significant rural disparities at the highest level of deprivation.
   Conclusions This study noted a differential effect in mortality-related
   outcomes among rural counties within comparable levels of community
   deprivation. Findings contribute to evidence that many, but not all
   rural communities face a double disadvantage. This underscores the need
   for a continued focus on the development and implementation of multiple
   policies aimed at reducing differences in poverty, education, and access
   to care.},

Abstract = {Children and adolescents are at high risk of traumatic brain injuries
   (TBI). To identify those most at risk across Europe, a comprehensive
   epidemiological study on the burden of TBI is needed. Our aim was to
   estimate the burden of TBI in the pediatric and adolescent population of
   Europe by calculating rates of hospital-based incidence, death and years
   of life lost (YLL) due to TBI in 33 countries of Europe in 2014 (most
   recent available data). We conducted a cross-sectional observational,
   population-based study. All cases with TBI in the age range 0 to 19,
   registered in the causes of death databases or hospital discharge
   databases of 33 European countries were included. Crude and
   age-standardized rates of hospital discharges, deaths and YLLs due to
   TBI; and pooled estimates for all countries combined were calculated.
   TBI caused 2303 deaths (71\% in boys), 154,282 YLLs (68\% in boys) and
   441,368 hospital discharges (61\% in boys) in the population of 0-19
   year-olds. We estimated pooled age-standardized rates of death (2.8,
   95\% CI: 2.4-3.3), YLLs (184.4, 95\% CI: 151.6-217.2) and hospital
   discharges (344.6, 95\% CI: 250.3-438.9) for the analyzed countries in
   2014. The population of 15-19 year-olds had the highest rates of deaths
   and YLLs, and the population of 0-4 year-olds had the highest rate of
   hospital discharges. Detailed estimates of hospital discharge, death and
   YLL rates based on high-quality, standardized data may be used to
   develop health policies, aid decision-making and plan prevention.},

Abstract = {Limited evidence on the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD) attributable to ambient temperature. We aim to explore the
   association between ambient temperature and years of life lost (YLL),
   and to get a more intuitive understanding of the dangers of COPD in
   China. Death and meteorological data of 31 Chinese provincial capital
   cities during 2008-2013 was analyzed in this study. Distributed Lag
   Non-linear Model (DLNM) was used to estimate the association between
   ambient temperature and mortality. The attributable fraction (AF) to
   cold effect ranged from 8.19 (95\%CI: -8.52,19.38) to 28.98 (95\%CI:
   -64.78,67.59), while the AF to heat effect varied from 0.02 (95\%CI:
   -0.13,0.05) to 5.73 (95\%CI: 0.31,10.22). Cold effect was higher than
   heat effect on COPD in women and elderly, heat effect was higher in men
   and younger. Low temperature can cause more serious disease burden of
   COPD than high temperature.},

Abstract = {From a public health point of view, years of life lost (YLL) is a more
   important index than the number of deaths to evaluate the effect of risk
   factors. The objective of the present study was to estimate the burden
   of disease including years of life lost (YLL) and expected life
   remaining (ELR) attributed to long-term exposure to PM2.5 in Ahvaz, one
   of the most polluted cities of the world, during March 2014 through
   March 2017. AirQ + software was used for the estimation of YLL and ELR
   due to all natural causes of death. Hourly concentrations of PM2.5 were
   acquired from the Department of Environment (DoE) of Ahvaz. Several
   steps were performed to validate the raw air quality data. Only the
   monitors were included that had minimum data completeness of 75\%. Two
   age groups were selected for this study, including 0-64 and 65 < years.
   The life table approach was used to estimate YLL and ELR. Annual
   averages of PM2.5 were 5.2-8 times higher than the air quality guideline
   (10 mu g/m(3)) set by WHO for long-term exposure to PM2.5. In total,
   PM2.5 has caused 234,041 years of life lost due to mortality. About 84\%
   of YLLs were attributed to people older than 65 years old. The YLLs of
   men were higher than those for women. The YLLs in the third year were
   greater than the first two years. PM2.5 has caused the average age of
   total population, people aged 0-64 years old, and people > 65 years old
   decreased by 2.5, 3, and 1.6 years, respectively. These studies
   indicated that people in a city that the air quality is highly affected
   by dust storms, industrial emissions, and urban air pollution are
   significantly at risk. Air pollution control strategies and actions
   should be designed and executed to improve the quality of ambient air.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To estimate premature mortality by age, sex and cause of
   death in India.
   Background: Studies on premature mortality in India are limited.
   Although evidence suggests recent reductions in infant and child
   mortality, little is known about the age and sex patterns of premature
   deaths in India.
   Methods: Secondary data from the Sample Registration System and, census
   of India and report on cause of death. A set of indices are used to
   estimate the premature mortality were analysed.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: Standardised years of potential
   life lost (YPLL), premature years of potential life lost (PYPLL) and
   working years of potential life lost (WYPLL) for broad age groups and by
   selected causes of death.
   Results: From 1991 to 2011, the age-standardised rate of YPLL (per 1000
   population) declined from 310 to 235 for males and from 307 to 206 for
   females. The estimated YPLL (in millions) declined from 134 to 147 for
   males and from 123 to 108 for females, the YPLL for adults (aged 15-65)
   increased by 32\% for males and 28\% for females, the standardised PYPLL
   (per 1000 population) declined from 259 to 137 for males and from 258 to
   115 for females, the estimated PYPLL increased by 13\% for all adult
   males and by 32\% for 30-45-year-ld adult males, and the standardised
   rate of WYPLL declined from 274 to 131 for males and from 295 to 91 for
   females. These findings suggest a significant improvement in early
   childhood mortality and increasing mortality trends in 30-45-year-old
   adult males. The YPLL and WYPLL standardised rates for males and females
   were highest for cardiovascular disease.
   Conclusions: The increasing share of premature deaths among adults and
   high levels of premature mortality suggest an improvement in child
   survival increased attention should be given to prevention and treatment
   of non-communicable diseases in order to avoid premature deaths in
   India.},

Title = {Years of life lost associated with COVID-19 deaths in the USA during the
   first year of the pandemic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Abstract = {Background Years of Life Lost (YLLs) measure the shortfall in life
   expectancy due to a medical condition and have been used in multiple
   contexts. Previously it was estimated that there were 1.2 million YLLs
   associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the USA
   through 11 July 2020. The aim of this study is to update YLL estimates
   for the first full year of the pandemic. Methods We employed data
   regarding COVID-19 deaths in the USA through 31 January 2021 by
   jurisdiction, gender and age group. We used actuarial life expectancy
   tables by gender and age to estimate YLLs. Results We estimated roughly
   3.9 million YLLs due to COVID-19 deaths, which correspond to roughly 9.2
   YLLs per death. We observed a large range across states in YLLs per 10
   000 capita, with New York City at 298 and Vermont at 12. Nationally, the
   YLLs per 10 000 capita were greater for males than females (136.3 versus
   102.3), but there was significant variation in the differences across
   states. Conclusions Our estimates provide further insight into the
   mortality effects of COVID-19. The observed differences across states
   and genders demonstrate the need for disaggregated analyses of the
   pandemic's effects.},

Title = {Ambient sulfur dioxide and years of life lost from stroke in China: a
   time-series analysis in 48 cities},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {267},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a ubiquitous air
   pollutant and its concentration in China remains at a higher level in
   the world. However, evidence regarding short-term effect of SO2 on years
   of life lost (YLL) from stroke is scarce. We aim to estimate the
   short-term association between SO2 pollution and YLL for stroke and the
   related excess life years and economic loss.
   Methods: A national time-series study was conducted in 48 Chinese cities
   from 2013 to 2017. Generalized additive model coupled with
   random-effects model were used to explore the effects of SO2 on YLL from
   stroke. Stratified analyses were performed by demographical and
   geographical factors, and the effect modification of city-level factors
   was estimated. In addition, the related economic loss was calculated
   using the method of the value per statistical life year (VSLY).
   Results: Averaged daily mean SO2 concentration was 27.1 mu g/m(3) in 48
   Chinese cities from 2013 to 2017. Per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in the
   concentration of SO2 (lag03) was associated with an increment of 0.70\%
   (95\% confidence interval: 0.27\%,1.13\%), 0.51\% (-0.01\%,1.04\%),
   0.71\% (0.14\%,1.28\%) increase in YLL from total stroke, hemorrhagic
   and ischemic stroke, respectively. The effect of short-term ambient SO2
   exposure on YLL from stroke was more pronounced in the less-educated
   population and those living in the south. The corresponding excess
   economic loss during the study period due to SO2-related YLL from stroke
   accounted for 0.08\% (0.03\%, 0.13\%) of the GDP in China.
   Conclusions: Our results provide evidence from China that short-term
   exposure to SO2 is positively associated with YLL from stroke and its
   major subtypes in certain subgroups of population. This study calls for
   greater awareness of the adverse health effect due to SO2 in China and
   other developing countries, as well as local-specific implementation of
   air pollution mitigation measures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Trend of nasopharyngeal carcinoma mortality and years of life lost in
   China and its provinces from 2005 to 2020},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER},
Abstract = {To examine the trends of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) mortality and
   years of life lost (YLL) in China and its provinces from 2005 to 2020,
   our study used data from China National Mortality Surveillance System
   (NMSS) to estimate the number and rate of mortality and YLL of NPC by
   age and sex. We calculated average annual percent change (AAPC) to
   describe the trend of NPC mortality and YLL over time. We also analyzed
   the proportion of NPC deaths in all cancer deaths and explored the
   drivers of change in NPC deaths by decomposition analysis. The
   age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of NPC in China had a significant
   downward trend from 2.0/100 000 in 2005 to 1.4/100 000 in 2020 (AAPC =
   -2.4, P < .05). Age-standardized YLL rate also showed the similar trends
   (AAPC = -2.8, P < .05). Southern provinces including Guangdong
   (163.9/100 000), Guangxi (130.5/100 000), and Hainan (105.6/100 000) had
   the highest YLL rate in 2020. The mortality and YLL rate increased with
   age and males were higher than females. From 2005 to 2020, the
   proportion of NPC deaths in all cancer deaths remained stable at around
   1.0\% in China. The total number of deaths of NPC increased by 7.3\%, of
   which age-specific mortality, population growth, and population aging
   accounted for -46.2\%, 8.5\% and 45.0\%, respectively. NPC remains a
   significant public health issue in China southern provinces and tailored
   prevention and control strategies should be strengthened to reduce the
   burden of premature mortality of NPC in high risk areas.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is an evaluation of years of life lost by
   inhabitants of Poland according to the most important causes of
   mortality and identification of trends in the period 2000-2014. The
   study material included a database which contained information gathered
   from 5,601,568 death certificates of inhabitants of Poland. In order to
   calculate years of life lost, the SEYLLp index (Standard Expected Years
   of Life Lost per living person) was applied. We also calculated AAPC
   (Average Annual Percentage Change). The SEYLLp index (per 10,000
   population) in Poland decreased from 2503.4 in 2000 to 2193.2 in 2014
   among males (AAPC= -0.8\%, p < 0.05) and from 1430.2 in 2000 to 1269.4
   in 2014 among females (AAPC= -0.6\%, p < 0.05). In 2014, the top 5
   causes of years of life lost were: cardiovascular diseases (721.4 per
   10,000 males and 475.6 per 10,000 females), malignant tumours (575.5 and
   418.3), unintentional injuries (202.2 and 46.8), intentional injuries
   (114.6 and 16.3) and digestive diseases (120.2 and 58.3). Due to
   negative trends, there is a need to implement preventative measures,
   aimed at reducing mortality caused by respiratory infections in both
   males and females, malignant tumours in females and diabetes mellitus
   and intentional injuries in males.},

Abstract = {Introduction The aim of the study is to evaluate the number of years of
   life lost in inhabitants of Poland due to bladder cancer (BC), identify
   trends of the mortality and calculate the pace of change which has
   happened over the period of the first fifteen years of the 21st century.
   Material and methods The study material was a database including 44,283
   death certificates of Polish inhabitants who died due to bladder cancer
   in the period 2000-2014. The number of years of life lost were
   calculated using the SEYLL indices: SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of
   Life Lost per living person) and SEYLLd (Standard Expected Years of Life
   Lost per death).
   Results The crude death rates (CDR) index increased from 10.79 per
   100,000 males in 2000 to 14.30 in 2014 (Annual Percentage Change {[}APC]
   = 2.1\%, p <0.05). In women, the group value of the CDR index increased
   from 2.50 in 2000 to 3.83 in 2014 (APC = 2.9\%, p <0.05). The
   standardized death rates (SDR) index fell from 23.27 in 2000 to 22.48 in
   2014 (APC = -0.1\%, p >0.05) in men, but rose from 3.54 in 2000 to 3.83
   in 2014 (APC = 0.4\%, p <0.05) in women. The SEYLLp index (per 100,000
   population) due to bladder cancer in Poland increased from 202.9 in 2000
   to 243.4 in 2014 (APC = 1.3\%, p < 0.05) in men, and from 40.4 in 2000
   to 60.1 in 2014 (APC = 2.7\%, p <0.05) in women.
   Conclusions Despite the prolongation of patient life, as shown by the
   SEYLLd factor, Polish patients still lose too many years of life due to
   BC than compared to United States patients.},

Title = {Premature mortality resilience and wellbeing within urban Maori
   communities},
Journal = {HEALTH \& PLACE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {49-56},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Maori (the indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand) experience of
   colonisation has negatively affected access to many of the resources
   (e.g. income, adequate housing) that enable health and well-being.
   However Maori have actively responded to the challenges they have faced.
   With the majority of the Maori population now living in urban settings
   this exploratory study aimed to understand factors contributing to
   mortality resilience despite exposure to socio-economic adversity with
   reference to Maori well-being. Resilient urban neighborhoods were
   defined as those that had lower than expected premature mortality among
   Maori residents despite high levels of socio-economic adversity.
   Selected resilience indicators theoretically linked to a Maori
   well-being framework were correlated with the novel Maori RINZ
   resilience index. Of the selected indicators, only exposure to crime
   showed a clear gradient across the resilience index as predicted by the
   Maori well-being framework. Future research is needed as unclear trends
   for other indicators may reflect limitations in the indicators used or
   the need to develop a more comprehensive measure of well-being.},

Title = {Years of Life Lost Due to Influenza-Attributable Mortality in Older
   Adults in the Netherlands: A Competing-Risks Approach},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {187},
Number = {8},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We estimated the influenza mortality burden in adults aged 60 years or
   older in the Netherlands in terms of years of life lost, taking into
   account competing mortality risks. Weekly laboratory surveillance data
   for influenza and other respiratory pathogens and weekly extreme
   temperature served as covariates in Poisson regression models fitted to
   weekly mortality data, specific to age group, for the period 1999-2000
   through 2012-2013. Burden for age groups 60-64 years through 85-89 years
   was computed as years of life lost before age 90 (YLL90), using
   restricted mean lifetime survival analysis and accounting for competing
   risks. Influenza-attributable mortality burden was greatest for persons
   aged 80-84 years, at 914 YLL90 per 100,000 persons (95\% uncertainty
   interval: 867, 963), followed by persons aged 85-89 years (787
   YLL90/100,000; 95\% uncertainty interval: 741, 834). Ignoring competing
   mortality risks in the computation of influenza-attributable YLL90 would
   lead to substantial overestimation of burden, from 3.5\% for persons
   aged 60-64 years to 82\% for those aged 80-89 years at death. Failure to
   account for competing mortality risks has implications for the accuracy
   of disease-burden estimates, especially among persons aged 80 years or
   older. Because the mortality burden borne by the elderly is notably
   high, prevention initiatives may benefit from being redesigned to more
   effectively prevent infection in the oldest age groups.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to debates on the broad determinants of health
   and on the policy shift from curative to preventive and protective
   interventions. It addresses empirically the relative importance of
   influences on health with a multiple regression analysis of ecologic
   data from the 49 counties of Ontario. One model achieved high predictive
   power (that is, Adj R-2>75\%, p < 0.0001). Educational levels were a
   strong predictor of population health, showing a consistent inverse
   relationship with premature mortality ratios for both sexes and it was
   the strongest predictor for females. A low income variable supplied the
   strongest prediction for male mortality. This variable displayed a
   positive association with male mortality. Municipal expenditures on
   environmental protection exerted a negative effect on male mortality.
   These findings raise questions about the current directions of health
   policy in Ontario where the provincial government has reduced funding to
   social and environmental programs, while promising to maintain health
   care funding. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fifteen-year mortality trends due to cardiovascular diseases in Poland
   using standard expected years of life lost, 2000-2014},
Journal = {KARDIOLOGIA POLSKA},

Abstract = {Background: Measures presenting the number of years of lost life point
   out social and economic aspects of premature mortality.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to determine trends and pace of changes in
   years of life lost, in inhabitants of Poland, in 2000-2014, due to
   cardiovascular diseases (CVD).
   Methods: The study material was a database including 2,587,141 death
   certificates of Polish inhabitants who died of CVD in 2000-2014. We
   applied the standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) indicators per
   living person (SEYLLp) and per death (SEYLLd) to calculate life years
   lost. We also estimated annual percentage changes (APC) and average
   annual percentage changes (AAPC) in the SEYLL indicators.
   Results: In 2000 the SEYLLp index due to CVD was 860.3 years per 10,000
   males and 586.9 years per 10,000 females. In 2000-2004 the indices were
   decreasing and the average annual rate was -0.8\% in the male group and
   -1.2\% in the female group. Eventually, in 2014 its values were 721.4
   years per 10,000 males and 475.6 years per 10,000 females. The
   respondents were losing years of life due to ischaemic heart disease
   (IHD) most rapidly (AAPC = -3.3\% in the male group and -3.2\% in the
   female group) and due to cerebrovascular diseases (AAPC = -2.5\% in the
   male group and AAPC = -3.3\% in the female group). On the other hand,
   there was an increase in the number of years of life lost due to heart
   failure (HF) (AAPC = 5.7\% in the male group and AAPC = 4.4\% in the
   female group). In 2014 SEYLLp due to IHD were 207.3 per 10,000 males and
   99.1 per 10,000 females, due to cerebrovascular diseases -124.3 and
   102.2, and due to HF -155.3 and 104.9. Each male who died of CVD lost on
   average 19.1 years in the year 2000 and 17.0 years in the year 2014
   (AAPC = -0.5\%). Regarding women, SEYLLd values were 12.6 years in 2000
   and 10.4 years in 2014 (AAPC = -1.4\%). A decrease in the SEYLLd value
   was observed in all analysed causes of mortality, in both males and
   females.
   Conclusions: Among CVDs, IHD and cerebrovascular diseases contribute to
   the highest number of years of life lost in inhabitants of Poland. The
   constant decline in the average number of years of life lost by each
   person who died of CVD might result from implementation of more
   effective prophylaxis and more effective treatment, which extend
   lifespan.},

Abstract = {Background: HIV epidemic is mostly targeted adults and has numerous
   negative health, social, economic, cultural and political consequences.
   In this study Life Expectancy (LE) and Average Years of Life Lost (AYLL)
   in HIV/AIDS patients are estimated.
   Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study all the patients at the
   age of 18 and more under the care of BandarAbbas Behavioral Disorders
   Counseling Center (BBDCC) during 2005-2015 are included. The town of
   BandarAbbas is center of Hormozgan Province in southern Iran. LE and
   AYLL have been estimated based on Life Table.
   Results: One hundred thirty four of the 426 eligible patients died
   during the study period. Compared to the general population LE for
   HIV/AIDS patients at age 20 is 46 years less in comparison with the
   general population of BandarAbbas. Moreover, a total of 8839 years of
   life lost during 2005-2015.
   Conclusion: LE in HIV/AIDS patients is less than LE among BandarAbbas
   general population and AYLL among them is more than general population.
   Most of the years of life lost are preventable if the health care system
   seriously will implement programs to control HIV/AIDS.},

Abstract = {Background: Every fourth death that occurs in Poland is caused by a
   malignant neoplasm. A particularly negative epidemiological situation
   relates to colorectal cancers; in 2015 they constituted the fifth most
   important cause of years of life lost (YLL) in Poland.
   Objective: We aimed to analyse YLL due to malignant neoplasms of the
   digestive system in Poland in between 2000 and 2014.
   Methods: The study material included a database containing information
   gathered from 5,601,568 death certificates of Poles who died in
   2000-2014. YLLs were calculated with the use of the standard expected
   years of life lost index (SEYLL).
   Results: In the 15-year study period, malignant neoplasms of the
   digestive system contributed to 213,041 deaths in males and 177,644
   deaths in females, which corresponded to a loss of 158.6 years per
   10,000 men and 105.3 years per 10,000 women. Neoplasms of the large
   intestine (23.6\%), stomach (22.0\%) and pancreas (17.4\%) contributed
   the most. A time trend analysis revealed (p < 0.05) a growing tendency
   of YLLs due to neoplasms of the large intestine and pancreas, and a
   decreasing trend due to neoplasms of the stomach.
   Conclusion: Malignant neoplasms of the digestive system, especially of
   the large intestine, are becoming a more common cause of premature
   mortality in Poland.},

Abstract = {Male hamsters of an inbred strain carrying a genetic trait for
   cardiomyopathy were dosed by sc injection weekly with an
   anabolic-androgenic steroid, nandrolone decanoate, beginning when 3
   months old.        Two groups (N=17) received doses of 2 and 4 mg per
   animal, while a vehicle control group received an equal volume of sesame
   oil. Rather than a hypothesized shortening of longevity, the steroid
   treatment significantly prolonged survival of the hamsters, which
   ordinarily die of congestive heart failure. At the median time to death
   for controls (355 days of age, 257 days of treatment), the steroid
   groups had mortality of only 2/17 and 4/17 (vs. 9/17, p < 0.01).},

Abstract = {Background: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are an important public health
   concern, and one of the main causes of death leading to loss of
   productive and effectual years of life. This study aimed to determine
   the economic burden of fatal crashes for about 5 years in Shahid Rajaei
   Hospital in Shiraz. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, cost and
   demographic data related to the people who died in the hospital due to
   RTIs, during 2009-2013, were obtained from medical records. Economic
   burden of traffic accidents that led to death was estimated using human
   capital as direct costs of treatment and potential years of life lost
   (PYLL) and lost productivity as indirect costs. Results: During
   2009-2013, 989 individuals died from traffic accidents in Shiraz,
   imposing 1.58 million US dollars to hospital costs, 41,298 PYLL, and 67
   million US dollars productivity lost. In this study, the mean age of the
   dead people was 43.3 +/- 22.24, and the productivity lost per capita was
   67,000 \$US. Conclusions: The economic burdens of traumatic brain
   injuries were high in fatal accidents in Fars Province equivalent to
   0.0003\% of Iran's gross domestic product in 2013. Thus, special
   attention should be directed toward prevention measures for fatal
   traffic accidents.},

Title = {Effects of Extreme Temperatures on Years of Life Lost for Cardiovascular
   Deaths: A Time Series Study in Brisbane, Australia},

Abstract = {Background-Extreme temperatures are associated with cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) deaths. Previous studies have investigated the relative
   CVD mortality risk of temperature, but this risk is heavily influenced
   by deaths in frail elderly people. To better estimate the burden of
   extreme temperatures, we estimated their effects on years of life lost
   due to CVD.
   Methods and Results-The data were daily observations on weather and CVD
   mortality for Brisbane, Australia, between 1996 and 2004. We estimated
   the association between daily mean temperature and years of life lost
   due to CVD, after adjusting for trend, season, day of the week, and
   humidity. To examine the nonlinear and delayed effects of temperature, a
   distributed lag nonlinear model was used. The model's residuals were
   examined to investigate whether there were any added effects due to cold
   spells and heat waves. The exposure-response curve between temperature
   and years of life lost was U-shaped, with the lowest years of life lost
   at 24 C. The curve had a sharper rise at extremes of heat than of cold.
   The effect of cold peaked 2 days after exposure, whereas the greatest
   effect of heat occurred on the day of exposure. There were significantly
   added effects of heat waves on years of life lost.
   Conclusions-Increased years of life lost due to CVD are associated with
   both cold and hot temperatures. Research on specific interventions is
   needed to reduce temperature-related years of life lost from CVD deaths.

Abstract = {Background and aims: More than 25,000 people die of liver cancer
   annually in India. There is little information about the contribution of
   hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) to these deaths. We
   conducted a systematic review of published studies on HBV or HCV
   infection and liver cancer in India and estimated the population
   attributable fraction (PAF) of liver cancer deaths caused by these
   infections and the corresponding annual number of deaths and years of
   life lost (YLL) in the country.
   Methods: We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases, as well as the
   reference list of relevant articles in the systematic review. For
   calculation of the number of liver cancer deaths attributable to HBV and
   HCV, we used two sources of outcome data and two relative risks for the
   association between HCV and liver cancer.
   Results: The PAF was 67\% for HBV, 17-19\% for HCV, and 71-72\% for HBV
   and/or HCV. The annual attributable number of liver cancer deaths was
   approximately 17,000 for HBV; 4500 for HCV; and 18,500 for HBV and/or
   HCV, corresponding to approximately 297,000, 75,000, and 315,000 YLL,
   respectively. There was little difference in these numbers using the two
   sources of outcome data or the two risk estimates for HCV.
   Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of primary
   prevention of HBV and HCV by appropriate measures, including vaccination
   (HBV only), prevention of transfusion-related infections, and increased
   awareness of the routes of transmission and long-term health outcomes.

Abstract = {Objective: To apply a `health gain' approach to population-based cancer
   control.
   Method: We calculated the potential years of life otherwise lost
   prematurely which could be `regained' through implementation of cancer
   control programs for which Level I or Level II evidence already exists
   for population outcomes.
   Results: More potential years of life lost (PYLLs) would be `regained'
   by enforcing a `smoke-free' Australia than by any other possible
   scenario based on proven effectiveness. Even achievable scenarios for
   tobacco control (17\% or 20\% prevalence) would `regain' more PYLL than
   either mammographic screening according to national policy or faecal
   occult blood testing (FOBT) of both men and women over 50 years for
   colorectal cancer.
   Conclusions: As few commentators remain optimistic that more money will
   be allocated to health, strategic thinking for health gain needs to
   re-appraise resource allocation for population-based cancer control in
   Australia.
   Implications: We recommend wider debate in response to our finding that,
   on the basis of best available evidence, the greatest potential for
   health gain lies less in cancer screening than fully funded tobacco
   control.},

Abstract = {Background: Tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of
   mortality related to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This study aimed
   to estimate the direct economic burden and years of life lost (YLL)
   attributable to smoking in NCDs in Mashhad, 2015-2016. Methods:
   Hospital-based data were utilized to calculate the economic burden of
   four selected diseases related to smoking. An epidemiological
   population-attributable risk method was used to determine the
   smoking-attributable fraction (SAF). Moreover, the study was conducted
   by data related to disease-specific expenditures and patients'
   information on cost and the number of mortality for estimating the YLL
   for each disease, population and life expectancy data, the prevalence of
   smoking, and the relative risk of smoking. Data analysis was performed
   with STATA software, version 12. Results: The total costs attributable
   to smoking for stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer were 94148, 151272, 1191396,
   and 574784 US Dollars, respectively (per 100000). In 2015, the YLL per
   deaths due to COPD were 4217 and 3522 among males and females,
   respectively. Furthermore, in 2016, the YLL per deaths due to the stroke
   in males and females were 8317 and 7563, respectively. In the same year,
   the highest proportion of years of potential life lost per 100000
   smoking-attributable deaths belonged to COPD. Conclusions: The results
   of this study can be used to inform policy-makers about
   smoking-attributable diseases in Iran. To decrease the
   smoking-attributable costs, which have resulted in the spread of NCDs,
   policy-makers should adopt and implement effective policies regarding
   smoking prevention and control.},

Abstract = {Lipoprotein(a) levels are approximately three to four times higher in
   patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared to controls
   with normal renal function (H.J. Parra, H. Mezdour, C. Cachera et al.,
   Clin. Chem. 33 (1987), 721). Hypertriglyceridemia occurs in
   approximately 50\% of ESRD patients receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD)
   treatment and has been associated with an increased prevalence of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) in cross-sectional studies of this subset
   of ESRD patients. We recently reported that HD patients with
   pre-existing ischemic or atherosclerotic CVD and patients with elevated
   Lp(a) levels had an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal clinical
   events attributable to CVD during a 48-month period of maintenance HD
   treatment. The current report describes a detailed analysis of study
   participants who did or did not have a history of ischemic CVD or
   angiographically documented severe atherosclerotic lesions prior to
   entry into our prospective study. Although baseline total cholesterol
   (TC), triglyceride (TG) and apoprotein B (apoB) levels were higher in
   the 36 participants with prevalent CVD than the remaining 93 study
   participants, total cholesterol levels were somewhat lower, while serum
   triglyceride levels were no different in patients who survived or
   experienced fatal CVD events during the period of observation on HD
   treatment. In contrast, Lp(a) levels were no different in participants
   with or without evidence of pre-existing CVD. Lp(a) was, however, an
   independent predictor of fatal events attributable to cardiovascular
   disease during the period of follow-up.},

Title = {Premature Mortality Due to Tobacco-Related Malignancies in Poland},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {2171-2182},
Abstract = {Introduction: Although in Poland at the turn of the 20th and 21st
   centuries, tobacco consumption per capita was one of the highest in the
   world as a result of specific political and social conditions,
   nicotinism was the most common preventable cause of death that reduced
   life expectancy by 10 years on average. The aim of this study is to
   determine the level of premature mortality and its trends by age and sex
   for tobacco-related malignancies in Poland in the years 2008-2017.
   Methods: The standardised premature mortality rates as well as mortality
   rates for five-year age ranges according to the patients' sex were used.
   The Joinpoint model was used to determine the time trends.
   Results: Premature mortality due to all tobacco-dependent cancers
   analysed decreased in Poland throughout the analysed period in both male
   (2.5\% per year) and female (1\% per year) populations. A detailed
   analysis of individual diseases showed that a decrease in premature
   mortality was observed for almost all malignancies with the exception of
   malignant liver cancer among males, malignant oesophageal cancer among
   females and malignant lip, oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer in both
   sexes. The reduction in mortality from all tobacco-related cancers in
   the male population was greatest between 40 and 44 years of age,
   reaching 5.6\% year on year. Similarly, in the case of females, the
   decline in mortality was greater in the younger age cohorts and
   decreased in those aged over 50.
   Conclusion: The favourable phenomenon of decreasing the level of
   premature mortality caused by tobacco-related malignancies may be
   associated, among others, with the policy of primary prevention of these
   diseases in the form of a widespread ban on smoking in public places,
   intensive information campaigns on the harmfulness of tobacco smoking
   and increasing taxation on tobacco products.},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe regional trends in premature mortality in
   Manitoba.
   Design: Comparison of all-cause and cause-specific mortality of persons
   less than the age 75 in 11 Regional Health Authority populations over
   two time periods: 1985-89 and 1990-94.
   Results: The provincial premature mortality rate declined over the two
   time periods (4.00/1,000 to 3.72/1,000). Declines were also observed in
   9 of 11 regional populations. Premature mortality increased, however, in
   the two regional populations with the highest mortality rates in the
   first observation period.
   Conclusion: Declining premature mortality in low mortality populations
   and rising premature mortality in high mortality populations has
   resulted in a widening of regional mortality rates in Manitoba. Recent
   Policy initiatives in many provinces, including the devolution of
   authority for the management and delivery of health services and the
   implementation of population need-based funding formulas to share health
   care resources among regional health authorities, if implemented, have
   the potential to partially mitigate the processes producing these
   widening regional health inequalities.},

Abstract = {Objective-To investigate the pattern and size of the relationship
   between social deprivation in electoral wards and premature mortality
   for each health region in England.
   Design-Ecological study using 1981 census variables and data on
   mortality for 1981-5.
   Setting-14 regional health authorities in England.
   Main outcome measure-Mortality under the age of 65 years from all
   causes, coronary heart disease, and smoking related diseases in men and
   women.
   Results-Increasing deprivation was significantly associated with
   mortality from all causes, coronary heart disease, and smoking related
   diseases. The relationship was linear with no apparent threshold.
   Correlation coefficients were generally greater for deaths from all
   causes and smoking related diseases and for men compared with women. The
   slope of the relationship between deprivation and mortality varied among
   regions. Variations in mortality still existed between regions for equal
   levels of deprivation.
   Conclusion-Deprivation of an area and premature mortality are strongly
   linked. The effects of deprivation can be seen throughout the range of
   affluence and are not limited to the poorest areas. Current targets for
   reducing coronary heart disease mortality may be achievable if the
   mortality in poor areas can be reduced to the rates in affluent areas.},

Title = {Assessing the disease burden of Yi people by years of life lost in
   Shilin county of Yunnan province, China},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Background: Years of Life Lost (YLL) is one of the methods used to
   estimate the duration of time lost due to premature death. While
   previous studies of disease burden have been reported using YLL, there
   have been no studies investigating YLL of Yi people in rural China.
   Yunnan Province ranks first in terms of Yi people in China. This paper
   uses YLL to estimate the disease burden of Yi people in Shilin county of
   Yunnan Province. This study aims to address the differentials about YLL
   between Yi people and Han people for providing useful information for
   health planning.
   Methods: We applied the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) method created by
   WHO. YLL rate per 1,000 were calculated from medical death certificates
   in 2003 in Shilin Yi Nationality Autonomous County (Shilin county).
   Results: The male had greater YLL rate per 1,000 than did the female
   almost in each age group. It demonstrated a higher premature mortality
   burden due to injuries in Shilin county. Among the top non-communicable
   diseases, respiratory diseases are the most common mortality burden. Yi
   people are still suffering from maternal conditions, with two times the
   burden rates of Han people. For Yi people, while malignant neoplasm was
   one of the least burden of disease for male, it was the greatest for
   female, which is the opposite to Han people.
   Conclusion: Strategies of economic development should be reviewed to
   enhance the prevention and treatment of injuries, maternal conditions
   and respiratory diseases for Yi people.},

Title = {Years of life lost and life expectancy attributable to ambient
   temperature: a time series study in 93 Chinese cities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Although increasing evidence has reported that unfavorable temperature
   may lead to increased premature mortality, a systematic assessment is
   lacking on the impact of ambient temperature on years of life lost (YLL)
   and life expectancy in China. Daily data on mortality, YLL,
   meteorological factors and air pollution were obtained from 93 Chinese
   cities during 2013-2016. A two-stage analytic approach was applied for
   statistical analysis. At the first stage, a distributed lag non-linear
   model with a Gaussian link was used to estimate the city-specific
   association between ambient temperature and YLLs. At the second stage, a
   meta-analysis was used to obtain the effect estimates at regional and
   national levels. We further estimated the corresponding YLLs and average
   life expectancy loss per deceased person attributable to the non-optimum
   temperature exposures based on the established associations. We observed
   `U' or `J' shaped associations between daily temperature and YLL. The
   heat effect appeared on the current day and lasted for only a few days,
   while the cold effect appeared a few days later and lasted for longer.
   In general, 6.90\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 4.62\%, 9.18\%) of
   YLLs could be attributed to non-optimum temperatures at the national
   level, with differences across different regions, ranging from 5.36\%
   (95\% CI: -3.36\%, 6.89\%) in east region to 9.09\% (95\% CI: -5.55\%,
   23.73\%) in northwest region. For each deceased person, we estimated
   that non-optimum temperature could cause a national-averaged 1.02 years
   (95\% CI: 0.68, 1.36) of life loss, with a significantly higher effect
   due to cold exposure (0.89, 95\% CI: 0.59, 1.19) than that of hot
   exposure (0.13, 95\% CI: 0.09, 0.16). This national study provides
   evidence that both cold and hot weather might result in significant YLL
   and lower life expectancy. Regional adaptive policies and interventions
   should be considered to reduce the mortality burden associated with the
   non-optimum temperature exposures.},

Title = {Adverse Childhood Experiences and the Risk of Premature Mortality},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2009},

Abstract = {Background: Strong, graded relationships between exposure to childhood
   traumatic stressors and numerous negative health behaviors and outcomes,
   healthcare utilization, and overall health status inspired the question
   of whether these adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated
   with premature death during adulthood.
   Purpose: This study aims to determine whether ACEs are associated with
   an increased risk of premature death during adulthood.
   Methods: Baseline survey data on health behaviors, health status, and
   exposure to ACEs were collected from 1.7,337 adults aged >18 years
   during 1995-1997. The ACEs included abuse (emotional, physical, sexual);
   witnessing domestic violence; parental separation or divorce; and
   growing up in a household where members were men tally ill, substance
   abusers, or sent to prison. The ACE score (air integer count of the
   eight categories of ACEs) was used as a measure of cumulative exposure
   to traumatic stress during childhood. Deaths were identified during
   follow-up assessments (between baseline appointment date and December
   31, 2006) using mortality records obtained from a search of the National
   Death Index. Expected years of life lost (YLL) and yews of potential
   life lost (YPLL) were computed using standard methods. The relative fisk
   of death from all causes at age <= 65),cars and at age <= 75 years was
   estimated across the number of categories of ACEs using
   multivaribale-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. Analysis was
   conducted during January-February 2009.
   Results: Overall, 1539 people died during follow-up; the crude death
   rate was 91.0 per 1000; the age-adjusted rate was 54.7 per 1000. People
   with six or more ACEs died nearly 20 years earlier on average than those
   without ACEs (60.6 years, 95\% CI = 56.2, 65.1, vs 79.1 years, 95\% CI =
   78.4, 79.9). Average YLL per death was nearly three times greater among
   people with six or more ACEs (25.2 years) than those without ACEs (9.2
   years). Roughly one third (n = 526) of those who died during follow-up
   were aged <= 75 years at the time of death, accounting for 4792 YPLL.
   After multivariable adjustment, adults with six or more ACEs were 1.7
   (95\% CI = 1.06, 2.83) times more likely to die when aged <= 75 years
   and 2.4 (95\% CI = 1.30, 4.39) times more likely to die when aged <= 65
   years.
   Conclusions: ACEs are associated with an increased risk of premature
   death, although a graded increase in the risk of premature death was not
   observed across the number of categories of ACEs. The increase in risk
   was only partly explained by documented ACE-related health and social
   problems, suggesting other possible mechanisms by which ACEs may
   contribute to premature death. (Am J Prev Med 2009;37(5):389-396)

Abstract = {Objectives: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is leading cause of death in
   China. We aimed to provide national and subnational estimates and its
   change of premature mortality burden of CVD during 2005-2020. Methods:
   Data from multi-source on the basis of national mortality surveillance
   system (NMSS) was used to estimate mortality and years of life lost
   (YLL) of total CVD and its subcategories in Chinese population across 31
   provinces during 2005-2020. Results: Estimated CVD deaths increased from
   3.09 million in 2005 to 4.58 million in 2020; the age-standardized
   mortality rate (ASMR) decreased from 286.85 per 100,000 in 2005 to
   245.39 per 100,000 in 2020. A substantial reduction of 19.27\% of CVD
   premature mortality burden, as measured by age-standardized YLL rate,
   was observed. Ischemic heart disease (IHD), hemorrhagic stroke (HS) and
   ischemic stroke (IS) were leading 3 causes of CVD death. Marked
   differences were observed in geographical patterns for total CVD and its
   subcategories, and it appeared to be lower in areas with higher economic
   development. Population ageing was dominant driver contributed to CVD
   deaths increase, followed by population growth. And, age-specific
   mortality shifts contributed largely to CVD deaths decline in most
   provinces. Conclusion: Substantial discrepancies were demonstrated in
   CVD premature mortality burden across China. Targeted considerations
   were needed to integrate primary care with clinical care through
   intensifying further strategies for reducing CVD mortality among
   specific subcategories, high risk population and regions with inadequate
   healthcare resources.},

Abstract = {Background: Life expectancy with dementia directly influences rates of
   prevalence and service needs and is a common question posed by families
   and patients. As well as years of survival, it is useful to consider
   years of life lost after a diagnosis of dementia.
   Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature on mortality and
   survival with dementia which were compared to estimated life
   expectancies in the general population. Both were then compared by age
   (under 65 years vs. 65+ years), gender, dementia type, severity, and two
   epochs (prior to and after introduction of cholinesterase inhibitors in
   1997).
   Results: Survival after a diagnosis of dementia varies considerably and
   depends on numerous factors and their complex interaction. Relative loss
   of life expectancy decreases with age at diagnosis across varying
   gender, dementia subtypes (except for frontotemporal dementia and
   dementia with Lewy bodies), and severity stages. Numerous study
   deficiencies precluded a meta-analysis of survival in dementia.
   Conclusion: Estimates of years of life lost through dementia may be
   helpful for patients and their families. Recommendations for future
   research methods are proposed.},

Title = {Pancreatic cancer in Poland: an analysis of incidence, mortality and
   years of life lost over a period of 22 years},
Journal = {MEDICAL STUDIES-STUDIA MEDYCZNE},

Abstract = {Introduction: Due to the late diagnosis and lack of standardized
   screening tests, pancreatic cancer is one of the world's most lethal
   neoplasms. Over the last 30 years incidence and mortality has more than
   doubled globally and the overall pancreatic cancer burden is thought to
   increase along with the increase of average life expectancy.
   Aim of the research: To analyze countrywide trends, age patterns and
   burden of premature mortality due to pancreatic cancer in 1996-2018.
   Material and methods: All calculations are based on publicly available
   data. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were used to
   present incidence and mortality statistics comparable across time. Years
   of potential life lost (YPLL) were calculated by applying the up-to-date
   reference life tables.
   Results: During the analyzed period the overall pancreatic cancer
   incidence and mortality increased by 18\% and 45\%, respectively. Both
   standardized incidence and mortality rates, however, decreased among men
   and remained relatively stable among women. The number of YPLL increased
   by 23\%, with the highest values being observed in the 65- 69 age group.
   Meanwhile, a decrease in the mean YPLL value has been observed.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the mean age of death due to
   pancreatic cancer has increased. Evidence of the change in incidence and
   mortality related to population ageing might be used by policymakers to
   improve the healthcare system in addressing the increasing health needs
   of the elderly population as well as to enhance primary preventive
   methods in the younger age.},

Title = {Trends in lifetime risk and years of life lost due to diabetes in the
   USA, 1985-2011: a modelling study},

Abstract = {Background Diabetes incidence has increased and mortality has decreased
   greatly in the USA, potentially leading to substantial changes in the
   lifetime risk of diabetes. We aimed to provide updated estimates for the
   lifetime risk of development of diabetes and to assess the effect of
   changes in incidence and mortality on lifetime risk and life-years lost
   to diabetes in the USA.
   Methods We incorporated data about diabetes incidence from the National
   Health Interview Survey, and linked data about mortality from 1985 to
   2011 for 598 216 adults, into a Markov chain model to estimate remaining
   lifetime diabetes risk, years spent with and without diagnosed diabetes,
   and life-years lost due to diabetes in three cohorts: 1985-89, 1990-99,
   and 2000-11. Diabetes was determined by self-report and was classified
   as any diabetes, excluding gestational diabetes. We used logistic
   regression to estimate the incidence of diabetes and Poisson regression
   to estimate mortality.
   Findings On the basis of 2000-11 data, lifetime risk of diagnosed
   diabetes from age 20 years was 40.2\% (95\% CI 39.2-41.3) for men and
   39.6\% (38.6-40.5) for women, representing increases of 20 percentage
   points and 13 percentage points, respectively, since 1985-89. The
   highest lifetime risks were in Hispanic men and women, and non-Hispanic
   black women, for whom lifetime risk now exceeds 50\%. The number of
   life-years lost to diabetes when diagnosed at age 40 years decreased
   from 7.7 years (95\% CI 6.5-9.0) in 1990-99 to 5.8 years (4.6-7.1) in
   2000-11 in men, and from 8.7 years (8.4-8.9) to 6.8 years (6.7-7.0) in
   women over the same period. Because of the increasing diabetes
   prevalence, the average number of years lost due to diabetes for the
   population as a whole increased by 46\% in men and 44\% in women. Years
   spent with diabetes increased by 156\% in men and 70\% in women.
   Interpretation Continued increases in the incidence of diagnosed
   diabetes combined with declining mortality have led to an acceleration
   of lifetime risk and more years spent with diabetes, but fewer years
   lost to the disease for the average individual with diabetes. These
   findings mean that there will be a continued need for health services
   and extensive costs to manage the disease, and emphasise the need for
   effective interventions to reduce incidence.},

Title = {Years of life lost from ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke related to

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {203},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Few multicity studies have been conducted in developing countries to
   distinguish the acute effects of ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on the
   years of life lost (YLL) from different subtypes of stroke. We aimed to
   differentiate the associations between NO2 exposure and YLL from major
   pathological types of stroke in China, and estimate the relevant
   economic loss. A time-series study was conducted to explore the
   associations between short-term NO2 exposure and YLL from ischaemic and
   haemorrhagic stroke from 2013 to 2017 in 48 Chinese cities. Daily NO2
   data and stroke mortality counts for each city were obtained from the
   National Urban Air Quality Real-time Publishing Platform and Chinese
   Center for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively. Generalized
   additive models were applied to estimate the cumulative effects of NO2
   in each city, and meta-analysis was used to combine the city-specific
   estimates. The relevant economic loss was estimated using the method of
   the value per statistical life year (VSLY). A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in
   ambient NO2 concentration on the present day and previous day (lag 0-1)
   would lead to relatively higher increments in percentage change of YLL
   from ischaemic stroke (0.82\%, 95\% CI: 0.46\%, 1.19\%) than
   haemorrhagic stroke (0.46\%, 95\% CI: 0.09\%, 0.84\%). The association
   was significantly stronger in the low-education population than
   high-education population for ischaemic stroke. Furthermore,
   significantly higher association was found in South China than those in
   North China for both subtypes of stroke. Economic loss due to excess YLL
   from ischaemic stroke related to NO2 exposure was higher than that for
   haemorrhagic stroke. Our study indicated higher association and economic
   loss of ischaemic than haemorrhagic stroke related to NO2 exposure in
   China, which informed priorities for type-specific stroke prevention
   strategies related to NO2 pollution and vulnerable population
   protection.},

Title = {Standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) due to chronic obstructive

Abstract = {Purpose
   The aim of the study is to analyze the standard expected years of life
   lost (SEYLL) due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in
   Poland from 1999 to 2014 by sex and place of residence.
   Methods
   The number of deaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (J40
   -J44 and J47 according to ICD-10) over the period 1999 to 2014 was
   analyzed based on data obtained from the Central Statistical Office in
   Poland. Standard expected years of life lost due to chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease were calculated by sex and place of residence
   according to the living population (SEYLLp) and the number of deaths
   caused by the disease (SEYLLd). Changes in the calculated measures were
   evaluated using joinpoint models. The annual percentage change (APC) and
   the average annual percentage change (AAPC) were also calculated.
   Results
   The study revealed that COPD contributed to 1.8\% of the total number of
   deaths which occurred between 1999 and 2014. The greatest decrease in
   the analyzed measures was observed among males from rural areas (p<
   0.05) (SEYLL: AAPC = -1.6; 95\% CI: -3.0;-0.2; SEYLLp: AAPC = -2.0; 95\%
   CI: -3.4;-0.6; SEYLLd: AAPC = -1.1; 95\% CI: -1.2;-0.9). A statistically
   significant increase in the SEYLL and SEYLLp indices was observed among
   female city dwellers (SEYLL: AAPC = 2.4; 95\% CI: 0.7; 4.0 and SEYLLp:
   AAPC = 2.4; 95\% CI: 0.8; 4.1).
   Conclusions
   All studied measures were higher in the male group than in the female
   group, regardless of the place of residence. A male who died of COPD in
   Poland in 2014 potentially lost 14.9 years of life, whereas a female
   lost 14.2 years.},

Abstract = {Aims: This study compared the cause-specific standardized mortality
   ratios (SMRs) and expected years of life lost (EYLL) among
   opioid-dependent individuals in the United States and Taiwan.
   Methods: Survival data came from two cohorts followed until 2014: The
   U.S. data were based on a randomized trial of 1267 opioid-dependent
   participants enrolled between 2006 and 2009; the Taiwan data were from a
   study of 983 individuals that began in 2006, when opioid agonist
   treatment (OAT) was implemented in Taiwan. SMRs were calculated for each
   national cohort and compared. Kaplan-Meier estimation was performed on
   the survival data, then lifespans were extrapolated to 70 years (840
   months) to estimate life expectancy using a semi-parametric method.
   EYLLs for both cohorts were estimated by subtracting their life
   expectancies from the age- and gender-matched referents within the
   general population of their respective country.
   Results: Compared with age- and gender-matched referents, the SMRs were
   3.2 for the U.S. sample and 7.8 for the Taiwan sample; the EYLLs were
   7.7 and 16.4 years, respectively. Half of decedents died of unnatural
   causes in both cohorts; overdose deaths predominated in the U.S. and
   suicide in Taiwan.
   Conclusions: Our study identified differences by country in EYLL and
   causes of deaths. These findings suggest that intervention strategies to
   reduce mortality risk by overdose (particularly in the U.S.) and suicide
   (particularly in Taiwan) are urgently needed in these countries. (C)

Title = {The Impact of Non-optimum Ambient Temperature on Years of Life Lost: A
   Multi-county Observational Study in Hunan, China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The ambient temperature-health relationship is of growing interest as
   the climate changes. Previous studies have examined the association
   between ambient temperature and mortality or morbidity, however, there
   is little literature available on the ambient temperature effects on
   year of life lost (YLL). Thus, we aimed to quantify the YLL attributable
   to non-optimum ambient temperature. We obtained data from 1 January 2013
   to 31 December 2017 of 70 counties in Hunan, China. In order to combine
   the effects of each county, we used YLL rate as a health outcome
   indicator. The YLL rate was equal to the total YLL divided by the
   population of each county, and multiplied by 100,000. We estimated the
   associations between ambient temperature and YLL with a distributed lag
   non-linear model (DNLM) in a single county, and then pooled them in a
   multivariate meta-regression. The daily mean YLL rates were 22.62
   y/(p100,000), 10.14 y/(p100,000) and 2.33 y/(p100,000) within the study
   period for non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease
   death. Ambient temperature was responsible for advancing a substantial
   fraction of YLL, with attributable fractions of 10.73\% (4.36-17.09\%)
   and 16.44\% (9.09-23.79\%) for non-accidental and cardiovascular disease
   death, respectively. However, the ambient temperature effect was not
   significantly for respiratory disease death, corresponding to 5.47\%
   (-2.65-13.60\%). Most of the YLL burden was caused by a cold temperature
   than the optimum temperature, with an overall estimate of 10.27\%
   (4.52-16.03\%) and 15.94\% (8.82-23.05\%) for non-accidental and
   cardiovascular disease death, respectively. Cold and heat
   temperature-related YLLs were higher in the elderly and females than the
   young and males. Extreme cold temperature had an effect on all age
   groups in different kinds of disease-caused death. This study highlights
   that general preventative measures could be important for moderate
   temperatures, whereas quick and effective measures should be provided
   for extreme temperatures.},

Title = {Projection of the Years of Life Lost, Years Lived with Disability, and

Abstract = {Background: Projection of future trends in disease burden can facilitate
   setting of priorities for health policies and resource allocation. We
   report here projections of disease-specific mortality and the burdens of
   various diseases in Korea from 2016 to 2030.
   Methods: Separate age-and sex-specific projection models for 21 major
   cause clusters from 2016 to 2030 were developed by applying coherent
   functional data models based on historical trends from 2002 to 2015. The
   age- and sex-specific years of life lost (YLL) for each cause cluster
   were projected based on the projected number of deaths. Years lived with
   disability (YLD) projections were derived using the 2015 age-and
   sex-specific YLD to YLL ratio. The disability-adjusted life years
   (DALYs) was the sum of YLL and YLD.
   Results: The total number of deaths is projected to increase from
   275,777 in 2015 to 421,700 in 2030, while the age-standardized death
   rate is projected to decrease from 586.9 in 2015 to 447.3 in 2030. The
   largest number of deaths is projected to be a result of neoplasms
   (75,758 deaths for males; 44,660 deaths for females), followed by
   cardiovascular and circulatory diseases (34,795 deaths for males; 48,553
   deaths for females). The three leading causes of DALYs for both sexes
   are projected to be chronic respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal
   disorders, and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
   Conclusion: We demonstrate that NCDs will continue to account for the
   majority of the disease burden in Korea in the future.},

Journal = {SPINAL CORD},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {540-544},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Study Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Objectives: To identify factors predictive of survival after spinal cord
   injury (SCI).
   Setting: Tertiary care institution.
   Methods: Multiple-variable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis
   for 759 patients with SCI (535 nontraumatic and 221 traumatic) included
   age, sex, completeness of injury, level of injury, functional
   independence measure (FIM) scores, rehabilitation length of stay and SCI
   cause. Estimated years of life lost in the decade after injury was
   calculated for patients vs uninjured controls.
   Results: Median follow-up was 11.4 years. Population characteristics
   included paraplegia, 58\%; complete injury, 11\%; male sex, 64\%; and
   median rehabilitation length of stay, 16 days. Factors independently
   predictive of decreased survival were increased age (+10 years; hazard
   ratio (HR (95\% CI)), 1.6 (1.4-1.7)), male sex (1.3 (1.0-1.6)), lower
   dismissal FIM score (-10 points; 1.3 (1.21.3)) and all nontraumatic
   causes. Metastatic cancer had the largest decrease in survival (HR (95\%
   CI), 13.3 (8.7-20.2)). Primary tumors (HR (95\% CI), 2.5 (1.7-3.8)),
   vascular (2.5 (1.6-3.8)), musculoskeletal/stenosis (1.7 (1.2-2.5)) and
   other nontraumatic SCI (2.3 (1.5-3.6)) were associated with decreased
   survival. Ten-year survival was decreased in nontraumatic SCI (mean
   (s.d.), 1.8 (0.3) years lost), with largest decreases in survival for
   metastatic cancer and spinal cord ischemia.
   Conclusions: Age, male sex and lower dismissal FIM score were associated
   with decreased survival, but neither injury severity nor level was
   associated with it. Survival after SCI varies depending on SCI cause,
   with survival better after traumatic SCI than after nontraumatic SCI.
   Metastatic cancer and vascular ischemia were associated with the
   greatest survival reduction.},

Abstract = {Though some studies have explored the association between temperature
   and years of life lost (YLL), limited evidence is available regarding
   the effect of temporal variation on the temperature-YLL relationship,
   especially in developing countries. We explored temporal variation in
   the associations between temperature and YLL before and after 2013 heat
   waves (period I: Jan 2008 to Sep 2013, period II: Oct 2013 to Dec 2015)
   in Ningbo, a southern China city with typical subtropical climate. The
   heat associations showed an increasing trend. The number of YLL due to
   heat-related respiratory mortality was significantly higher in period II
   (46.03, 95\% CI: 11.97, 80.08) than in period I (7.21, 95\% CI: -10.04,
   24.46) among married individuals. In contrast, the cold associations
   presented an attenuating trend, and the number of YLL due to
   non-accidental mortality was significantly lower in period II (262.32,
   95\% CI: -304.18, 828.83) than in period I (916.78, 95\% CI: 596.05,
   1237.51). These results indicate more effort still needed to be made to
   reduce heat-related YLL even after periods of extreme heat. Furthermore,
   using YLL provided complementary information for identifying vulnerable
   subgroups, which has important implications for the planning of public
   health interventions.},

Abstract = {Background With the rapid development of the socioeconomic status, the
   mortality of several cancers has been changed in China during the past
   30 years. We aimed to estimate the trends of mortality and years of life
   lost (YLLs) of various cancers in urban and rural areas of China from
   1990 to 2017. Methods The mortality data were collected from Chinese
   yearbooks and the age structure of population from the Chinese sixth
   population census were used as reference to calculate age-standardized
   mortality rates (ASMRs) and YLLs rates. Joinpoint regression analysis
   was implemented to calculate the annual percent change (APC) of
   mortality rates and YLL rates for cancers. YLLs owing to premature death
   were calculated as age-specific cancer deaths multiplied by the
   reference life expectancy at birth of 80 years for male and 82.5 years
   for female. Results The ASMRs of all cancers showed significant
   decreasing trends for urban residents from 1990 to 2017, such downward
   trend without significance was also observed among rural residents.
   Interestingly, ASMRs of lung cancer and breast cancer have raised
   continuously in rural areas since 1990. The age-standardized YYL rates
   for urban and rural residents decreased with 1.02\% and 0.85\% per year,
   respectively. YLLs in rural areas were higher than those in urban areas,
   whereas YLLs of urban outstripped those of rural finally with the
   increasing in YLLs of urban areas (216.71\% for men and 207.87\% for
   women). Conclusion The ASMRs and YLL rates of all cancers have declined
   in urban and rural areas from 1990 to 2017. YLLs increased in urban
   areas and remained higher level in rural areas after 2014 year.
   Preventive measures should be strengthened to against cancer, especially
   for lung cancer.},

Abstract = {We quantified the impact of type 2 diabetes on incidence of non-fatal
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, considering CVD as a
   continuum from occurrence of diabetes to the end point, and estimated
   the 15-year life expectancy with and without CVD.
   A total of 7239 Iranian adults (3246 men), aged >= 30 years, were
   followed from 1999 to 2014. We applied a multi-state semi-Markov model
   with three transitions including CVD-free to non-fatal CVD, CVD-free to
   death and non-fatal CVD to death, and studied the influence of diabetes
   on each transition rate, stratifying by sex and adjusting for
   confounders.
   Diabetes was significantly associated with increased risk of non-fatal
   CVD in men {[}hazard ratio, 1.70 (1.36-3.53)] and women {[}2.19
   (1.74-2.77)], and of all-cause death {[}2.72 (2.03-3.63) and 1.92
   (1.37-2.67) in men and women, respectively]. An increased risk of
   mortality was found only among diabetic men, when non-fatal CVD was
   occurred {[}2.19 (1.36-3.53)]. Men with diabetes experienced first
   non-fatal CVD and death without CVD 1.7 and 1.4 years, respectively,
   earlier than those without diabetes; the corresponding values were 1.4
   and 0.7 years for women. Moreover, diabetic men lived 1.3 years less
   than non-diabetic counterparts when non-fatal CVD was occurred.
   Diabetes increased the risk of non-fatal CVD events and all-cause
   mortality and consequently decreased the number of years lived without
   CVD. A decrease in LE was found only among diabetic men compared to
   non-diabetics after non-fatal CVD occurred.},

Abstract = {Cold spells and heat waves in a changing climate are well known as great
   public-health concerns due to their adverse effects on human health.
   However, very few studies have quantified health impacts of heat and
   cold in the region of Northwestern China. The purpose of the present
   study was to evaluate the effects of cold and heat on years of life lost
   (YLL) in Lanzhou, a city with temperate continental climate. We compiled
   a daily dataset including deaths, weather variables, and air pollutants
   in Lanzhou, China, from 2014-2017. We used a distributed lag non-linear
   model to estimate single-day and cumulative effects of heat and cold on
   daily YLL. Results indicated that both cold and heat were associated
   with increased YLL for registered residents in Lanzhou. Estimated heat
   effects appeared immediately in the first two days, while estimated cold
   effects lasted over a longer period (up to 30 days). Cold significantly
   increased the YLL of all residents except for males and those with
   respiratory diseases (>= 65 years). Our results showed that both heat
   and cold had more pronounced effects on cardiovascular diseases compared
   to respiratory diseases. Males might be more vulnerable to heat, while
   females might suffer more YLL from cold. The effects of cold or heat on
   the elderly might appear earlier and last longer than those for other
   age groups.},

Abstract = {The effect modification of meteorological factors on the association
   between ambient Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and mortality is critical for
   designing intervention policy. Existing studies did not result in
   consistent conclusions on the effect modification, and Years of life
   lost (YLLs) was rarely used as a health impact indicator to examine the
   modifying effect. This study aims to estimate the mean air temperature
   and relative humidity modification effects on the impact of SO2 on daily
   mortality and YLLs in Chengdu, China. Mortality, YLLs, air pollution and
   meteorological data were collected for 2011-2014. Three analytical
   approaches based on generalized additive models (GAMS,) were used,
   including bivariate response surface model, product term model, and
   stratification model. We found that the effects of SO2 on mortality and
   YLLs depended on temperature at various lags, but did not depend on
   relative humidity. SO2 exhibited larger adverse effects on mortality in
   high temperature level (22.8-29.4 degrees C) days than in low
   temperature level (03-93 degrees C) days, with a 10 mu g/m(3) increment
   in SO2, non accidental death increased by 0.8\% (0.001, 0.015)at low
   temperature level, but increased by 1.4\% (0.005, 0.024) at high
   temperature level. On the contrary, SO2 showed greater adverse effects
   on YLLs in low temperature days than in high temperature days, with a 10
   mu g/m(3) increment in SO2, non -accidental YLL increased by 40.580
   (31.478, 49.682) at high temperature level, but increased by -2.703
   (-14.668, 9.261) at low temperature level. We concluded that the effect
   of SO2 on mortality and YLLs may depend on temperature in Chengdu,
   China. Our results highlight the importance of considering the
   interaction between SO2 and temperature on health outcomes in future
   research. Also, policy makers should enhance the emission control of SO2
   in extreme temperature days in Chengdu. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth cause of cancer death
   in China. We aimed to provide national and subnational estimates and
   changes of CRC premature mortality burden during 2005-2020. Methods:
   Data from multi-source on the basis of the national surveillance
   mortality system were used to estimate mortality and years of life lost
   (YLL) of CRC in the Chinese population during 2005-2020. Estimates were
   generated and compared for 31 provincial-level administrative divisions
   in China. Results: Estimated CRC deaths increased from 111.41 thousand
   in 2005 to 178.02 thousand in 2020; age-standardized mortality rate
   decreased from 10.01 per 100,000 in 2005 to 9.68 per 100,000 in 2020.
   Substantial reduction in CRC premature mortality burden, as measured by
   age-standardized YLL rate, was observed with a reduction of 10.20\%
   nationwide. Marked differences were observed in the geographical
   patterns of provincial units, and they appeared to be obvious in areas
   with higher economic development. Population aging was the dominant
   driver which contributed to the increase in CRC deaths, followed by
   population growth and age-specific mortality change. Conclusions:
   Substantial discrepancies were observed in the premature mortality
   burden of CRC across China. Targeted considerations were needed to
   promote a healthy lifestyle, expand cost-effective CRC early screening
   and diagnosis, and improve medical treatment to reduce CRC mortality
   among high-risk populations and regions with inadequate healthcare
   resources.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to analyse years of life lost due to selected
   malignant neoplasms of the digestive system (colorectum, stomach, and
   pancreas) in Poland, a post-communist country in Central Europe,
   according to socioeconomic variables: sex, age, level of education,
   marital status, working status, and place of residence. The study
   included a dataset comprising death certificates of Polish citizens from
   2002 (N = 359 486) and 2011 (N = 375 501). The data on deaths caused by
   malignant neoplasms of the digestive system, that is, coded as C15-C26
   according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
   Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, was analyzed. The standard
   expected years of life lost meter was used to calculate years of life
   lost. In 2002, malignant neoplasms of the digestive system caused 25 024
   deaths among Polish citizens (7.0\% of all deaths), which translated
   into a premature loss of 494 442.1 years of life (129.4 years per 10 000
   people). In 2011, the number of deaths increased to 26 537 (7.1\% of all
   deaths) and the number of years of life lost rose to 499 804.0 (129.7
   years per 10 000). The most important causes of mortality and years of
   life lost were colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic cancers. In both
   studied years, the socioeconomic features with an adverse effect on
   years of life lost due to each considered malignant neoplasm of the
   digestive system included male gender, lower than secondary education,
   widowed marital status, economic inactivity, living in urban areas.
   Years of life lost analysis constitutes a valuable part of
   epidemiological assessment of health inequalities in society. It appears
   that the observed inequalities may have many causes; however, further
   research is needed to better understand their full extent.},

Abstract = {Background: High blood pressure is the second Most important risk factor
   of cardiovasoular diseases (CVDs) in Iran. It is imperative to estimate
   the burden of CVDs that den be averted if high blood pressure is
   controlled at the population level: The aim Of the current study was
   to:estimate the avertable CVD mortality in the setting of Golestan
   Cohort Study (GCS).
   Methods: Over 50,000 participants were recruited and followed for a
   median of 7 years. The exposures of interest in this study were
   non-optimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) and hypertension measured at
   baseline. Deaths by cause have been precisely recorded. The Population
   Attributable Fraction (PAF) of deaths and Years of Life Lost (YLLs) due
   to CVDs attributable to exposures of interest were calculated.
   Results: Overall, 223 deaths due to ischemic head disease (IHD), 207
   deaths due to cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), and 460 deaths due to all
   CVDs could be averted if the SBP of all subjects in the study Were
   optimal. Similarly, 5,560 YLLs due to IHD, 4,771 YLLs due CVA, and
   11,135 YLLs due to CVDs could be prevented if SBP were optimal. In all
   age groups, the avertable deaths and YLLs were higher due to IHD
   compared with CVA. Deaths and YLLs attributable to non-Optimal SBP in
   women were less than-men
   Conclusions: A very large proportion of CVD deaths can be averted if
   blood pressure is controlled in Iran. Effective interventions in primary
   and secondary health care-setting are mandatory to be implemented as
   early as possible.},

Abstract = {To better understand premature mortality due to cancer, we estimated
   years of life lost (YLL) and average years of life lost (AYLL) due to
   cancer for the years 1995 and 2005, based on data from the Vital
   Statistic of japan. In men, we identified a total of 159,623 cancer
   deaths in 1995 and 196,603 in 2005. Total YLL were 2,342,560.4 and
   2,724,066.0 years, respectively. Averaged for all cancers, people died
   14.7 years earlier than life expectancy in 1995 and 13.9 years in 2005.
   AYLL was longest for brain cancer deaths, at 26.3 years earlier than
   expected in 1995 and 22.8 years in 2005, followed by leukemia. In women,
   a total of 103,399 cancer deaths occurred in 1995 and 129,338 in 2005.
   Total YLL were 1,818,960.4 years in 1995 and 2,160,706.5 years in 2005,
   corresponding to AYLL for all cancer combined of 17.6 and 16.7 years.
   The AYLL of brain cancer deaths was also the longest, at 29.4 years in
   1995 and 27.8 in 2005, followed by leukemia and female sex-related
   cancers. Results showed that cancer of the stomach, colorectum, liver
   and lung were the most frequent cancers in both sexes in both 1995 and
   2005 and responsible for a remarkable number of YLL. Further, AYLL was
   greatest for brain cancer and leukemia in both sexes and for sex-related
   cancers in women, namely breast, cervix and ovarian cancer.},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Although adults with schizophrenia have a significantly
   increased risk of premature mortality, sample size limitations of
   previous research have hindered the identification of the underlying
   causes.
   OBJECTIVE To describe overall and cause-specific mortality rates and
   standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for adults with schizophrenia
   compared with the US general population.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We identified a national retrospective
   longitudinal cohort of patients with schizophrenia 20 to 64 years old in
   the Medicaid program (January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2007). The cohort
   included 1 138 853 individuals, 4 807 121 years of follow-up, and 74 003
   deaths, of which 65 553 had a known cause.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality ratios for the schizophrenia cohort
   standardized to the general population with respect to age, sex,
   race/ethnicity, and geographic region were estimated for all-cause and
   cause-specific mortality. Mortality rates per 100 000 person-years and
   the mean years of potential life lost per death were also determined.
   Death record information was obtained from the National Death Index.
   RESULTS Adults with schizophrenia were more than 3.5 times (all-cause
   SMR, 3.7; 95\% CI, 3.7-3.7) as likely to die in the follow-up period as
   were adults in the general population. Cardiovascular disease had the
   highest mortality rate (403.2 per 100 000 person-years) and an SMR of
   3.6 (95\% CI, 3.5-3.6). Among 6 selected cancers, lung cancer had the
   highest mortality rate (74.8 per 100 000 person-years) and an SMR of 2.4
   (95\% CI, 2.4-2.5). Particularly elevated SMRs were observed for chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (9.9; 95\% CI, 9.6-10.2) and influenza and
   pneumonia (7.0; 95\% CI, 6.7-7.4). Accidental deaths (119.7 per 100 000
   person-years) accounted for more than twice as many deaths as suicide
   (52.0 per 100 000 person-years). Nonsuicidal substance-induced death,
   mostly from alcohol or other drugs, was also a leading cause of death
   (95.2 per 100 000 person-years).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a US national cohort of adults with
   schizophrenia, excess deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory
   diseases implicate modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including
   especially tobacco use. Excess deaths directly attributable to alcohol
   or other drugs highlight threats posed by substance abuse. More
   aggressive identification and management of cardiovascular risk factors,
   as well as reducing tobacco use and substance abuse, should be leading
   priorities in the medical care of adults with schizophrenia.},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION Tobacco smoking is a significant public health threat in
   the world, a risk factor for many diseases, and has been increasing in
   prevalence in many developing countries. In this study, we aimed to
   estimate the burden of premature deaths attributable to smoking among
   Tunisian men aged 35-69 years in 2009.
   METHODS The number of deaths attributable to smoking was estimated using
   the population attributable risk fraction method. Smoking prevalence was
   obtained from a nationally representative survey. Causes of death were
   obtained from the registry of the National Public Health Institute.
   Relative risks were taken from the American Cancer Society Prevention
   Study (CPS-II).
   RESULTS Total estimated premature deaths attributable to smoking among
   men in Tunisia were 2601 (95\% CI: 2268-2877), accounting for 25\% (95\%
   CI: 23.3-26.6) of total male adult mortality. Cancer, cardiovascular and
   respiratory diseases were the major causes of premature deaths
   attributable to smoking with 1272 (95\% CI: 1188-1329), 966 (95\% CI:
   779-1133) and 364 (300-415) deaths, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS Tobacco smoking is highly relevant and is related to
   substantial premature mortality in Tunisia, around double that estimated
   for the region as a whole. This also has not decreased over the past 20
   years. Urgent actions are needed to reduce this pandemic.},

Abstract = {The authors estimated the number of premature deaths from particulate
   matter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) that would result from making 29
   proposed fossil fuel power plants in Virginia operational. We used a
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency air quality model (Climatological
   Regional Dispersion model) to calculate changes in ambient
   concentrations Of PM2.5 and Cox proportional hazard modeling to
   calculate the resulting premature mortality. The model predicted that if
   all 29 plants were operational, PM2.5 concentrations would rise in 271
   counties across 19 states 5 and increased average annual PM2.5
   concentrations would result in a rate of 17 deaths per 37,900,026 people
   aged 30 yr and older (0.45 deaths per million, 95\% confidence interval
   = 0.31, 0.59) per year by the end of 2004, increasing thereafter. Over a
   6 yr period, 104 cumulative excess deaths would occur due to operations
   of these proposed plants. The authors recommend that precautionary
   principles be considered when policy decisions related to energy
   production from fossil fuels are made.},

Title = {Spatial Distribution of PM2.(5)-Related Premature Mortality in China},
Journal = {GEOHEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {PM2.5 is a major component of air pollution in China and has a serious
   threat to public health. It is very important to quantify spatial
   characteristics of the health effects caused by outdoor PM2.5 exposure.
   This study analyzed the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration
   (45.9 mu g/m(3)national average in 2016) and premature mortality
   attributed to PM2.5 in cities at the prefectural level and above in
   China in 2016. Using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM), the
   total premature mortality in China was estimated to be 1.55 million
   persons, and the per capita mortality was 11.2 per 10,000 persons in the
   year 2016, resulting in higher estimates compared to the integrated
   exposure-response model. We assessed the premature mortality attributed
   to PM2.5 through common diseases, including ischemic heart disease
   (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (CEV), chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD), lung cancer (LC), and lower respiratory infections
   (LRI). The premature mortality due to IHD and CEV accounted for 68.5\%
   of the total mortality, and the per capita mortality (per 10,000
   persons) for all ages due to IHD was 3.86, the highest among diseases.
   For the spatial distribution of disease-specific premature mortality,
   the top two highest absolute numbers of premature mortality associated
   with IHD, CEV, LC, and LRI, respectively, were found in Chongqing and
   Beijing. In 338 cities of China, we have found a significant positive
   spatial autocorrelation of per capita premature mortality, indicating
   the necessity of coordinated regional governance for an efficient
   control of PM2.5.
   Plain Language Summary Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations
   have increased in general, in most developing countries in recent
   decades. In China, PM2.5 pollution has become a major component of air
   pollution and has serious health impacts. To obtain a comprehensive
   understanding of the national health impacts of PM2.5 in China, we have
   used the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to estimate the
   premature mortality associated with PM2.5 exposure in 338 cities in
   China at the prefectural level and above. In addition, we analyzed the
   spatial distribution of premature mortality attributed to PM2.5 for five
   diseases, including ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular
   disease (CEV), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer
   (LC), and lower respiratory infections (LRI). Our study finds that the
   total premature mortality associated with PM2.5 exposure in China for
   2016 was 1.55 million persons. The top two highest absolute numbers of
   premature mortality associated with IHD, CEV, LC, and LRI, respectively
   were found in Chongqing and Beijing. Furthermore, cities with high per
   capita premature mortality tended to be spatially connected with other
   cities with high per capita premature mortality, indicating the
   coordinated regional governance should be adopted to reduce the impact
   of PM2.5 on human health.},

Abstract = {Mortality in people with epilepsy has not previously been estimated in
   Georgia. We identified a prevalent cohort of people with epilepsy from a
   tertiary referral centre in Tbilisi, Georgia and attempted to establish
   survivorship status for all. One-way sensitivity analysis estimating
   mortality rates in those lost to follow-up was also used. Of 1952
   people, 1250 (64\%) were located; 93 (7\%) had died over a median of 11
   years follow up. The main cause specific Proportional Mortality Ratios
   were: underlying diseases (39\%) and accidental death (9\%). One SUDEP
   was confirmed with a further 4 possible, but the cause of death was
   unknown in 47\%. The overall SMR was 1.4, with much higher SMRs (up to
   12) in young people. The sensitivity analysis suggested an SMR of 3.0.

Abstract = {Objective: This study was conducted to determine whether beer
   consumption is associated with premature mortality across municipalities
   in Louisiana. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional ecologic study
   using tax data on the sales of beer and mortality data from Louisiana.
   We aggregated deaths that occurred before the age of 65 to the level of
   the municipality and calculated age-adjusted rates of both overall
   premature mortality and specific causes of premature mortality that may
   be related to alcohol. After controlling for potential confounders
   including population distributions for race, income, employment and
   education, we examined whether beer sales were independently associated
   with premature mortality rates due to homicides, unintentional injuries,
   other acute alcohol-related causes, liver diseases, cardiovascular
   disease and other chronic alcohol-related causes. Results: After
   controlling for race and socioeconomic status, municipalities with
   greater beer consumption had higher premature mortality, with the model
   explaining up to 24\% of all premature deaths. Beer consumption was also
   independently associated with homicide, liver diseases and
   cardiovascular disease. Neither unintentional injuries nor other chronic
   alcohol-related causes of mortality were significantly associated with
   beer consumption. Conclusions: The population-level association between
   beer consumption and mortality may reflect population-level determinants
   of beer consumption as well as indirect health effects of alcohol
   consumption on persons who are not heavy drinkers.},

Abstract = {A common approach for measuring geographical inequalities in health has
   been to calculate deprivation scores for small areas and then to
   aggregate these into quintiles. Mortality rates may then be compared for
   the highest and lowest deprivation quintiles at two points in time and
   the change in the difference between the rates determines the extent to
   which inequalities have widened or narrowed. This `period-specific'
   approach to measuring inequalities is problematic both because
   deprivation calculated at different points in time is not directly
   comparable, and because the boundaries of the areas used for such
   analyses often change during the study period. Using 10,058 small areas
   for Scotland whose boundaries do not change between 1981 and 2001 we
   examine the deprivation (im)mobility of areas, identifying those that
   are persistently well-off, stable or deprived and those that improved or
   worsened during the period. We focus particularly on the 638
   persistently most deprived areas. We demonstrate, first and importantly,
   that premature mortality rates increased significantly over this twenty
   year period in these areas. Second, we examine which causes of death are
   mainly responsible for this increase; the risk of death from chronic
   liver disease, mental disorders due to alcohol, suicide and `other'
   causes increased considerably. The geographical approach we describe
   here is novel and provides new insights into the relationship between
   deprivation and premature mortality. We suggest that these persistently
   most deprived Scottish areas deserve special attention and may be
   particularly appropriate sites for public health interventions related
   to these causes of premature death. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Although many studies have found that women legislators pursue policies
   important to women, we know relatively little concerning the effect of
   women's descriptive representation (WDR) on women's quality of life. We
   address this question by examining the relationship between the election
   ofwomen state legislators and public health. Specifically, we estimate
   the effect of WDR on premature death rates from 1982 to 2010. We find
   that WDR serves to improve the well-being of both women and men.
   However, the effect of WDR on women's health is contingent on several
   important factors. First, the health-improving effects ofWDR are most
   strongly related to the descriptive representation of Democratic women.
   Second, the effect of Democratic WDR on women's health, relative to
   men's health, increases with the scale of the state's Medicaid program.
   Finally, we estimate the mediating role of nine specific policies,
   finding that four policies mediate the effect of Democratic WDR on
   premature mortality. Overall, our results suggest that policy remedies
   aimed at improving the severe underrepresentation ofwomen in government
   may help to improve the relatively low ranking of the United States on
   indicators of public health.},

Title = {Prevention Considerations in Cardiovascular Diseases regarding the
   premature mortality reduction},
Journal = {BALNEO RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-59},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction. Cardiovascular diseases are recognized as worldwide (1)
   and national public health issue (2, 3). This is argued by having a
   leading position in the structure of general mortality and disability,
   the substantial loss of quality of life and the health system needs for
   increased costs. Prevention and control of cardiovascular disease has
   become one of the priority directions for global and national
   noncommunicable disease control strategies developed to reduce premature
   mortality (1, 5). The major cardiovascular diseases mortality was
   identified some aspects of premature mortality among the adult
   population in the Republic of Moldova. Overall decrease of mortality due
   to cardiovascular diseases among adults (-5.9\%) has been accompanied by
   a relatively slower decrease in premature mortality (-2.4\%) in the
   Republic of Moldova (6). Primary, secondary and tertiary prevention
   measures are essential in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease
   and contribute to improving cardiovascular health at the population
   level. Nature is helping people to maintain their health through
   mechanisms much closer to them than pharmaceutical ones through the
   curative action of the various natural factors that form the climate of
   the respective territorial area.
   Material and method. There is a descriptive study based on statistical
   data of the World Health Organization and official vital statistics of
   the Republic of Moldova.
   Results and discussions. The climatic conditions of Moldova are
   favorable to cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation. Moldova is
   located in the temperate continental climate influenced by the proximity
   of the Black Sea and the interference of warm-humid air from the
   Mediterranean. The annual air temperatures average in the country is 9,3
   degrees C. In the Republic of Moldova the warm weather with a
   confortable temperature lasts 175 days and the relative humidity
   oscillates in the average from 66 to 87\%. The country's thermal regime
   is the most important curative factor for treating chronic diseases and
   opportunity for the amplification of medical rehabilitation programs for
   patients with cardiovascular diseases. Application of methods based on
   the action of climatic factors in cardiovascular rehabilitation process
   contributes to its efficiency. Increasing the role of tertiary
   prevention is a good practice for the quality improvement of medical
   services for this category of patients. By making appropriate, timely
   and complex measures of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention
   cardiovascular disease can be substantially prevented.
   Conclusions. Strengthening cardiovascular prevention centered on a
   complex approach to all its primary, secondary, and tertiary components
   is an opportunity to reduce premature mortality in the population.},

Title = {Premature Mortality for Chronic Diseases in the EU Member States},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Premature mortality, and especially premature mortality for chronic
   diseases, is a very important topic of public health, health care, or
   lifestyle of population. The main aim of countries is to reduce
   premature mortality, and therefore an analysis of the development and
   status of premature standardized death rates (SDR) is key for disclosure
   of successes or failures in this topic. A boxplot chart was used to
   detect extremes of SDR for both sexes. The gender ratio revealed the
   differences of mortality rates between men and women. Premature
   mortality declined steadily in the EU between 2000 and 2016. The men's
   premature SDR decreased from 390 to 275.9 between 2000 and 2016, while
   the women's rate declined from 180.1 to 138.2. On average, annual
   premature SDR dropped by 2.14\% for men and 1.64\% for women. Thus, the
   gender ratio (male/female) declined from 2.17 in 2000 to 2.0 in 2016,
   which is a positive change for gender gap closing. The highest
   proportion of premature mortality belonged to mortality for malignant
   neoplasms, where the rate was as high as 47\% for women and 32\% for men
   in 2016. Premature mortality for chronic disease is especially high in
   the ``new{''} EU member states.},

Abstract = {Objective: To study the impact of AIDS on premature mortality in the
   city of Amsterdam (1982-1992).
   Methods: We combined aggregated data from the Netherlands Central Bureau
   for Statistics with data from the municipal death and population
   registry and data from the Amsterdam AIDS surveillance system to
   calculate age standardized mortality rates for men aged 15-64 years and
   25-54 years and working years of potential life lost before 65 years
   (WYPLL).
   Results: AIDS was the leading cause of death for men aged 25-54 years in
   Amsterdam from 1990 onwards, and the third leading cause of death for
   men aged 15-64 years in 1991. In this larger age group AIDS will
   probably become the leading cause of death in the coming years. In 1991,
   AIDS was already the leading cause of WYPLL before 65 years for men in
   the 15-64 age group. Without AIDS, there would have been a decrease in
   premature WYPLL from 1982 onwards; however, because of AIDS the number
   of WYPLL is increasing again.
   Conclusion: AIDS has had a significant impact on the pattern of
   premature mortality in Amsterdam in the period 1982-1992. Its impact
   will probably increase over the next few years.},

Title = {Deciphering the premature mortality in PIGA-CDG - An untold story},
Journal = {EPILEPSY RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {170},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objective: Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) due to a defective
   phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class A protein (PIGA)
   is a severe X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.
   Seizures are often treatment refractory, and patients have intellectual
   disability and global developmental delay. Previous reports have
   suggested that patients with PIGA-CDG have a high risk of premature
   mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the observed high mortality and
   the causes of death in PIGA-CDG patients.
   Methods: We reviewed the literature and collected additional unpublished
   patients through an international network.
   Results: In total, we reviewed the data of 88 patients of whom 30
   patients born alive were deceased, and the overall mortality before the
   age of 20 years was 30 \% (26/88). Age at death ranged from 15 days to
   48 years of life. The median age at death was two years and more than
   half of the patients deceased in early childhood. The PIGA-specific
   mortality rate/1000 person-years was 44.9/1000 person-years (95 \%, CI
   31.4-64.3). There were no cases of definite or probable sudden
   unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and half of the patients died due
   to respiratory failure (15/30, 50 \%) or possible SUDEP (3/30, 10 \%).
   Three patients (10 \%) died from severe cardiomyopathy, liver failure
   and gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively. The cause of death was
   unclassified in nine patients (30 \%). Autopsies were rarely performed
   and the true cause of death remains unknown for the majority of
   patients.
   Significance: Our data indicate an increased risk of premature death in

Abstract = {This trends ecological study analyzes, across 17 autonomous communities
   of Spain from 1989 to 1998, the relationship between mortality (total
   and by main causes of death) and power relations (type of government:
   social democratic (SDP), conservative (CDP), and others), labor market
   variables, welfare state variables, income inequality, absolute income,
   poverty, and number of civil associations. The authors conducted a
   descriptive analysis; a bivariate analysis (Pearson correlation
   coefficients) between mortality and each of the independent variables;
   and a multivariate analysis, adjusting multilevel linear regression
   models. All dimensions of the conceptual power relations model were
   related to premature mortality in the direction hypothesized. The
   cross-pooled multilevel regression models show that total premature
   mortality in males, male and female cerebrovascular mortality, male and
   female cirrhosis mortality, and male lung cancer mortality decreased
   somewhat more in communities where primary health care reform was
   implemented more quickly. Premature mortality decreased somewhat more in
   SDP than in CDP communities for male and female total premature
   mortality, cerebrovascular mortality, and cirrhosis mortality, and male
   lung cancer mortality. These results are in accord with earlier studies
   that found a relationship among health indicators and variables related
   to labor market, welfare state, income inequalities, civil associations,
   and power relations.},

Title = {Preterm Delivery in Relation to Neighbourhood-Level Adult Premature
   Mortality},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the influence of neighbourhood-level adult
   premature mortality on a woman's risk of preterm delivery (PTD).
   Methods: We included 286 872 singleton live birth deliveries in Toronto,
   Ontario, between 2002 and 2011. The study exposure was neighbourhood
   premature mortality rate, expressed in quintiles (Q), among adults aged
   20 to 49 years living within each of Toronto's 140 neighbourhoods. The
   primary study outcome was PTD at 24 to 36 weeks' gestation. Logistic
   regression analysis generated unadjusted ORs, adjusted ORs, and 95\%
   CIs, controlling for maternal age, parity, marital status, material
   deprivation index Q, maternal and paternal birthplace, and infant sex.
   Results: For all 140 neighbourhoods, the mean rate of premature deaths
   was 0.66 per 100 females and 1.17 per 100 males aged 20 to 49 years. The
   rate of PTD increased linearly in relation to the neighbourhood rate of
   premature mortality among adult females, from 5.3 per 100 in Q1 with the
   lowest rate of premature mortality to 6.3 per 100 in Q5 (OR 1.22; 95\%
   CI 1.13 to 1.31). The adjusted ORs were attenuated but remained
   significant (1.13; 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.22). A similar pattern was
   demonstrated for the relation between neighbourhood premature mortality
   among adult males and PTD.
   Conclusion: Women residing in neighbourhoods with high rates of
   premature adult mortality are at elevated risk of PTD, even after
   adjusting for measured socioeconomic factors that include marital status
   and material deprivation. Copyright (C) 2016 The Society of

Title = {Premature mortality related to United States cross-state air pollution},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {578},
Number = {7794},
Pages = {261+},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Outdoor air pollution adversely affects human health and is estimated to
   be responsible for five to ten per cent of the total annual premature
   mortality in the contiguous United States(1-3). Combustion emissions
   from a variety of sources, such as power generation or road traffic,
   make a large contribution to harmful air pollutants such as ozone and
   fine particulate matter (PM2.5)(4). Efforts to mitigate air pollution
   have focused mainly on the relationship between local emission sources
   and local air quality(2). Air quality can also be affected by distant
   emission sources, however, including emissions from neighbouring federal
   states(5,6). This cross-state exchange of pollution poses additional
   regulatory challenges. Here we quantify the exchange of air pollution
   among the contiguous United States, and assess its impact on premature
   mortality that is linked to increased human exposure to PM2.5 and ozone
   from seven emission sectors for 2005 to 2018. On average, we find that
   41 to 53 per cent of air-quality-related premature mortality resulting
   from a state's emissions occurs outside that state. We also find
   variations in the cross-state contributions of different emission
   sectors and chemical species to premature mortality, and changes in
   these variations over time. Emissions from electric power generation
   have the greatest cross-state impacts as a fraction of their total
   impacts, whereas commercial/residential emissions have the smallest.
   However, reductions in emissions from electric power generation since
   2005 have meant that, by 2018, cross-state premature mortality
   associated with the commercial/residential sector was twice that
   associated with power generation. In terms of the chemical species
   emitted, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions caused the most
   cross-state premature deaths in 2005, but by 2018 primary PM2.5
   emissions led to cross-state premature deaths equal to three times those
   associated with sulfur dioxide emissions. These reported shifts in
   emission sectors and emission species that contribute to premature
   mortality may help to guide improvements to air quality in the
   contiguous United States.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) are leading causes
   of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, it is
   uncertain whether HDPs are associated with long-term risk of premature
   mortality (before age 70 years).
   OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to evaluate whether HDPs were
   associated with premature mortality.
   METHODS Between 1989 and 2017, the authors followed 88,395 parous female
   nurses participating in the Nurses' Health Study II. The study focused
   on gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia within the term HDPs.
   Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the
   associations between HDPs and premature mortality were estimated by
   using Cox proportional hazards models, with adjustment for relevant
   confounders.
   RESULTS The authors documented that 2,387 women died before age 70
   years, including 1,141 cancer deaths and 212 CVD deaths. The occurrence
   of HDPs, either gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia, was
   associated with an HR of 1.31 (95\% CI: 1.18 to 1.46) for premature
   death during follow-up. When specific causes of death were examined,
   these relations were strongest for CVD-related mortality (HR: 2.26; 95\%
   CI: 1.67 to 3.07). The association between HDPs and all-cause premature
   death persisted, regardless of the subsequent development of chronic
   hypertension (HR: 1.20 {[}95\% CI: 1.02 to 1.40] for HDPs only and HR:
   2.02 {[}95\% CI: 1.75 to 2.33] for both HDPs and subsequent chronic
   hypertension).
   CONCLUSIONS An occurrence of HDPs, either gestational hypertension or
   pre-eclampsia, was associated with an increased risk of premature
   mortality, particularly CVD mortality, even in the absence of chronic
   hypertension.},

Abstract = {Background: To examine trends in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD) mortality and years of life lost (YLL) due to COPD for all
   provinces in China during 2005-2020. Methods: Data for COPD mortality
   were derived from China National Mortality Surveillance System (NMSS).
   We analyzed the numbers and age-standardized rates of death and YLL due
   to COPD in China, during 2005-2020. We carried out decomposition
   analysis to analyze the drivers of change in COPD deaths during the
   study period. Results: The age-standardized mortality rate of COPD in
   China decreased significantly from 99.5/100,000 in 2005 to 50.5/100,000
   in 2020. Similar trend was seen in the age -standardized YLL rate. The
   mortality rate increased with age. During 2005-2020, the age
   -standardized mortality rate decreased in all provinces (except for
   Tibet) with the largest decline in Jilin (-77.8\%), Henan (-68.4\%) and
   Fujian (-67.1\%). The decreased number of deaths was decomposed as
   population growth (8.5\%) and population ageing (69.7\%) with offset by
   decline of age-specific mortality (-87.5\%). Conclusion: COPD remains an
   important public health problem in China, though significant reductions
   of COPD mortality and YLL rate were observed. Vigorous prevention and
   control strategies should be enhanced to improve the quality of life of
   COPD patients and reduce the premature death caused by COPD in Chinese
   population.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The present study is designed to estimate the health impact
   of alcohol consumption in terms of the number of deaths and person-years
   of life lost (PYLL) in Switzerland. To that end, three hypothetical
   situations have been compared to the current situation used as a
   reference. The underlying question was: how many deaths and person-years
   of life lost would be avoided if all individuals were: (1) non-drinkers,
   (2) low drinkers only or (3) both (either abstainers or low level
   drinkers)? Methods: Etiological fractions of alcohol-related health
   consequences by age and gender were applied to the officially reported
   numbers of deaths to estimate the total number of deaths and PYLL.
   Results: Depending upon the hypothetical situation, the estimated number
   of alcohol-related deaths varied between an overall net protective and
   an overall net causal effect: in situation (1), there would occur 730
   additional deaths in reference to the current situation (+1.2\% of the
   total alcohol-related mortality in Switzerland), whereas in situation
   (2) there would be 3460 deaths less (-5.5\%). Thus, the current
   situation in Switzerland would be preferable compared to a society, in
   which no one drinks alcohol. A society, however, in which every
   individual drinks at low levels, would be preferable to the current
   situation. The corresponding figures for PYLL are 23,596 vs. 29,229
   (6.4\% vs. 7.9\% of total PYLL). Conclusions: The hypothetical situation
   decisively impacts on the number of deaths attributable to alcohol. In
   contrast, it has much less influence on the number of alcohol-related
   PYLL. Thus, mortality is at least a questionable indicator of
   alcohol-related health outcomes. The study also indicated that more
   lives and PYLL were saved in the low-risk situation than in the
   abstinence situation. Public health policies should not concentrate on
   the promotion of abstinence.},

Title = {Increased burden of cardiovascular disease in people with liver disease:
   unequal geographical variations, risk factors and excess years of life
   lost},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background: People with liver disease are at increased risk of
   developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), however, there has yet been an
   investigation of incidence burden, risk, and premature mortality across
   a wide range of liver conditions and cardiovascular outcomes.
   Methods: We employed population-wide electronic health records (EHRs;
   from 1998 to 2020) consisting of almost 4 million adults to assess
   regional variations in disease burden of five liver conditions,
   alcoholic liver disease (ALD), autoimmune liver disease, chronic
   hepatitis B infection (HBV), chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) and
   NAFLD, in England. We analysed regional differences in incidence rates
   for 17 manifestations of CVD in people with or without liver disease.
   The associations between biomarkers and comorbidities and risk of CVD in
   patients with liver disease were estimated using Cox models. For each
   liver condition, we estimated excess years of life lost (YLL)
   attributable to CVD (i.e., difference in YLL between people with or
   without CVD).
   Results: The age-standardised incidence rate for any liver disease was
   114.5 per 100,000 person years. The highest incidence was observed in
   NAFLD (85.5), followed by ALD (24.7), HCV (6.0), HBV (4.1) and
   autoimmune liver disease (3.7). Regionally, the North West and North
   East regions consistently exhibited high incidence burden. Age-specific
   incidence rate analyses revealed that the peak incidence for liver
   disease of non-viral aetiology is reached in individuals aged 50-59
   years. Patients with liver disease had a two-fold higher incidence
   burden of CVD (2634.6 per 100,000 persons) compared to individuals
   without liver disease (1339.7 per 100,000 persons). When comparing
   across liver diseases, atrial fibrillation was the most common initial
   CVD presentation while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the least common.
   We noted strong positive associations between body mass index and
   current smoking and risk of CVD. Patients who also had diabetes,
   hypertension, proteinuric kidney disease, chronic kidney disease,
   diverticular disease and gastro-oesophageal reflex disorders had a
   higher risk of CVD, as do patients with low albumin, raised C-reactive
   protein and raised International Normalized Ratio levels. All types of
   CVD were associated with shorter life expectancies. When evaluating
   excess YLLs by age of CVD onset and by liver disease type, differences
   in YLLs, when comparing across CVD types, were more pronounced at
   younger ages.
   Conclusions: We developed a public online app
   (https://lailab.shinyapps.io/cvd\_in\_liver\_disease/) to showcase
   results interactively. We provide a blueprint that revealed previously
   underappreciated clinical factors related to the risk of CVD, which
   differed in the magnitude of effects across liver diseases. We found
   significant geographical variations in the burden of liver disease and
   CVD, highlighting the need to devise local solutions. Targeted policies
   and regional initiatives addressing underserved communities might help
   improve equity of access to CVD screening and treatment.},

Title = {Estimation of Excess Mortality and Years of Life Lost to COVID-19 in

Abstract = {We estimate the weekly excess all-cause mortality in Norway and Sweden,
   the years of life lost (YLL) attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden, and the
   significance of mortality displacement. We computed the expected
   mortality by taking into account the declining trend and the seasonality
   in mortality in the two countries over the past 20 years. From the
   excess mortality in Sweden in 2019/20, we estimated the YLL attributed
   to COVID-19 using the life expectancy in different age groups. We
   adjusted this estimate for possible displacement using an
   auto-regressive model for the year-to-year variations in excess
   mortality. We found that excess all-cause mortality over the epidemic
   year, July 2019 to July 2020, was 517 (95\%CI = (12, 1074)) in Norway
   and 4329 {[}3331, 5325] in Sweden. There were 255 COVID-19 related
   deaths reported in Norway, and 5741 in Sweden, that year. During the
   epidemic period of 11 March-11 November, there were 6247 reported
   COVID-19 deaths and 5517 (4701, 6330) excess deaths in Sweden. We
   estimated that the number of YLL attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden was
   45,850 {[}13,915, 80,276] without adjusting for mortality displacement
   and 43,073 (12,160, 85,451) after adjusting for the displacement
   accounted for by the auto-regressive model. In conclusion, we find good
   agreement between officially recorded COVID-19 related deaths and
   all-cause excess deaths in both countries during the first epidemic wave
   and no significant mortality displacement that can explain those deaths.},

Abstract = {Background. The mortality burden of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic
   remains controversial, in part because of delays in reporting of vital
   statistics that are traditionally used to measure influenza-related
   excess mortality. Here, we compare excess mortality rates and years of
   life lost (YLL) for pandemic and seasonal influenza in Mexico and
   evaluate laboratory-confirmed death reports.
   Methods. Monthly age-and cause-specific death rates from January 2000
   through April 2010 and population-based surveillance of influenza virus
   activity were used to estimate excess mortality and YLL in Mexico.
   Age-stratified laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 death reports were obtained
   from an active surveillance system covering 40\% of the population.
   Results. The A/H1N1 pandemic was associated with 11.1 excess all-cause
   deaths per 100 000 population and 445 000 YLL during the 3 waves of
   virus activity in Mexico, April-December 2009. The pandemic mortality
   burden was 0.6-2.6 times that of a typical influenza season and lower
   than that of the severe 2003-2004 influenza epidemic. Individuals aged
   5-19 and 20-59 years were disproportionately affected relative to their
   experience with seasonal influenza. Laboratory-confirmed deaths captured
   1 of 7 pandemic excess deaths overall but only 1 of 41 deaths in persons
   >60 years of age in 2009. A recrudescence of excess mortality was
   observed in older persons during winter 2010, in a period when influenza
   and respiratory syncytial virus cocirculated.
   Conclusions. Mexico experienced higher 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic mortality
   burden than other countries for which estimates are available. Further
   analyses of detailed vital statistics are required to assess
   geographical variation in the mortality patterns of this pandemic.},

Title = {A finite and stable exponential growth-adjusted indirect cost of cancer
   associated with discounted years of life lost in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {Background: The risk of getting cancer before full life expectancy and
   mortalities per year are on the rise in Saudi Arabia. Yet, evidence of
   economic burden of cancer in the country remains largely unknown. In
   order to provide evidence, we attempted to estimate the economic burden
   in terms of indirect cost associated with premature cancer deaths among
   the active or potentially economically active population aged 15-60
   years in Saudi Arabia.
   Method: Within the framework of the World Health Organization guide of
   identifying the economic consequences of disease and injury, our method
   employs cost-of-illness approach. This approach is based on a
   macroeconomic model that estimates the indirect cost of cancer in terms
   of total non-health gross domestic product resource loss associated with
   a disease. We used epidemiological, health system, and macroeconomic
   data for our estimation. We discounted the net loss at 3\% and computed
   an extension of the loss with a finite and stable upper limit proxied by
   non-health gross domestic product per capita. We carried out separate
   analyses for male and female. We conducted sensitivity analyses to
   account for uncertainties of epidemiological and economic factors on the
   robustness of the estimated economic burden. We varied the proportion of
   total cancer deaths, discount rate, and value of health expenditure per
   capita by +/- 20\%. We further determined which of these factors or
   parameters had the greatest uncertainty or variation on the net present
   value total non-health gross domestic product resource loss per Capita.
   Results: Our results indicate the indirect cost associated with cancer
   deaths among Saudi population aged 15-60 years to be Int\$ 2.57 billion
   of which Int\$ 1.46 billion (57\%) was accounted for by females. The
   total indirect loss of cancer deaths increased by 8\% to Int\$ 2.77
   billion when the loss is allowed to grow with a finite and stable upper
   limit proxied by non-health gross domestic product per capita over the
   discounted years of life lost per a death among female and male
   respectively. Much of the uncertainty in the determination of the value
   of the loss was accounted for by the proportion of total cancer deaths
   and discount rate, while health expenditure per capita was responsible
   for the least variability.
   Conclusion: Our findings reveal evidence of indirect cost associated
   with cancer premature deaths in Saudi Arabia. In order to develop cancer
   control actions, the results of this study can inform health system
   policymakers not only of the extent of the enormous economic burden but
   also drawing attention to epidemiological and economic factors that
   explain the variability of the burden.},

Title = {Impact of summer heat on mortality and years of life lost: Application
   of a novel indicator of daily excess hourly heat},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {596-603},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background- Previous studies have widely assessed heat-mortality
   relationships across global regions, while the epidemiological evidence
   regarding the heat effect on years of life lost (YLL) is relatively
   sparse. Current investigations using daily mean data cannot take hourly
   temperature variation into consideration and may underestimate heat
   effects. We developed a novel indicator, daily excess hourly heat
   (DEHH), to precisely evaluate the potential heat effects on mortality
   and YLL.
   Methods: Hourly data on temperature and daily information, including
   concentrations of air pollutants, relative humidity, and records of all
   registered deaths were obtained in Wuhan, China during the warm seasons
   (May September) of 2009-2012. DEHH, developed in this study, is defined
   as daily total hourly temperatures that exceed a specific heat
   threshold. By performing time series regression analyses, we assessed
   the changes in daily mortality and YLL per interquartile range (IQR)
   increase in DEHH across different lag days.
   Results: The heat threshold evaluated by the Akaike Information
   Criterion for DEHH calculation is 30 degrees C (92th percentile of
   whole-year mean temperature distribution). Daily average DEHH was 13.9
   degrees C, with an IQR of 19.9 degrees C. Linear exposure-response
   curves were found between DEHH and two health outcomes. Generally, heat
   effects lasted for 2-3 days and DEHH at lag 0-1 was most strongly
   associated with increased mortality and YLL. The effects were especially
   remarkable for stroke and ischemic heart disease mortality. Most intense
   effect on YLL was found in non-accidental deaths (20.11, 95\% confidence
   interval: 8.90-31.33) at lag 0-1. More DEHH-related mortality and YLL
   from cardiovascular deaths were observed among males. People aged 0-74
   years and males suffered more from YLL burden due to high temperatures.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that DEHH may be an alternative
   indicator to precisely measure heat effects on daily mortality and YLL.
   Further DEHH-based evidence from large scale investigations is needed so

Title = {The burden of sulfur dioxide pollution on years of life lost from
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A nationwide analysis in China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {194},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one of the major gaseous pollutants
   in China and other developing countries. Few multicity studies have been
   done to examine the short-term effect of SO2 on cause-specific years of
   life lost (YLL). This study was designed to investigate the burden of
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with SO2
   exposure.
   Methods: A 5-year time-series study was conducted in 48 Chinese cities
   from 2013 to 2017. Generalized additive models were first used to
   estimate the city-specific relationship. Then, random-effects
   meta-analyses were applied to pool the estimates. Furthermore, the roles
   of potential modifiers and the related economic loss estimated by the
   method of value per statistical life year were also evaluated.
   Results: The annual mean concentration of SO2 was 27.1 mu g/m(3). A 10
   mu g/m(3) increase in 4-day moving average (lag03) of SO2 concentration
   was associated with 0.83\% (95\% CI: 0.13\%, 1.53\%) relative increment
   in YLL from COPD, and relevant percent change of mortality was 0.78\%
   (95\% CI: 0.16\%, 1.41\%). Moreover, a significantly higher effect was
   observed in the warm season, particularly in the south region. SO2
   exposure was estimated to account for 1.89\% of the total economic loss
   due to YLL from COPD.
   Conclusions: Our findings showed a positive association between
   short-term exposure to SO2 and YLL from COPD and highlighted the
   importance of continuous control of SO2 pollution to reduce
   corresponding attributable disease burden.},

Abstract = {Objective: Road safety is an important public health issue worldwide.
   However, few studies have analyzed the association between criminalizing
   drunk driving and years of life lost (YLL) due to road traffic deaths
   (RTDs). Our study can provide useful information about this policy.
   Methods: We used interrupted time-series analysis to find the changes in
   monthly YLL and RTD before and after law enforcement began using RTD
   data from 2008 to 2014 in Tianjin. Results: After adjustment for
   seasonality, months, holidays, and the number of people in each
   district, criminalizing drunk driving was followed by a 11.1\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 1.1-21.1\%) reduction in risk of RTDs and a
   corresponding 778.1-year (95\% CI, 200-1,355.1) reduction in monthly
   YLL. The reduction in YLL was especially significant among males, those
   aged 16-64 years old, and suburban residents. Conclusions: This study
   highlights that the law can lead to a reduction in YLL due to RTDs in
   Tianjin, China. Large immediate public health benefits resulted from the
   new road traffic law in China. YLL provides a complementary measure for
   examining the effect of criminalization on drunk driving RTDs.},

Title = {The Decrease in Average Years of Life Lost Due to Breast Cancer in Japan

Abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in
   Japan. Its mortality rate has been increased in recent years. However,
   there has been no study examining the changes in premature mortality in
   Japanese women. In the present study, using two health indicators, years
   of life lost (YLL) and average of years of life lost (AYLL), we
   estimated the premature mortality due to breast cancer in Japan during
   the period from 1995 to 2006. YLL indicates how many years that life of
   a patient was shortened with the presence of cancer, and AYLL provides
   an average loss of expected years of life among these deceased persons.
   Results showed an increase in total YLL due to this condition from
   204,840.6 years in 1995 to 255,046.9 years in 2006. In each calendar
   year, YLL remained the highest in the group aged 50-59 years, accounting
   for 32\%-36\% of annual YLL. In contrast, we found a decrease in AYLL of
   breast cancer from 26.4 years in 1995 to 22.8 years in 2006; namely,
   breast cancer patients who died in 2006 lived an average 3.6 years
   longer than those who died in 1995. In conclusion, we show the decrease
   in AYLL of breast cancer deaths, despite the increase in total numbers
   of annual YLL during the study period. Thus, women with breast cancer
   have benefited from postponement of the deaths in 2006, compared to
   those in 1995, which may be related to the improvements in medical
   health care or appropriate prevention.},

Title = {Estimated Effect of Temperature on Years of Life Lost: A Retrospective
   Time-Series Study of Low-, Middle-, and High-Income Regions},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have reported a strong association between
   temperature and mortality. Additional insights can be gained from vest
   tigating the effects of temperature on years of life lost (YLL),
   considering the life expectancy at the time of death.
   OBJECTIVES: The goal of this work was to assess the association between
   temperature and YLL at seven low-, middle-, and high-income sites.
   METHODS: We obtained meteorological and population data for at least
   nine years from four Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites in Kenya
   (western Kenya, Nairobi), Burkina Faso (Nouna), and India (Vadu), as
   well as data from cities in the United States (Philadelphia, Phoenix)
   and Sweden (Stockholm). A distributed lag nonlinear model was used to
   estimate the association of daily maximum temperature and daily YLL,
   lagged 0-14 d. The reference value was set for each site at the
   temperature with the lowest YLL.
   RESULTS: Generally, YLL increased with higher temperature, starting day
   0. In Nouna, the hottest location, with a minimum YLL temperature at the
   first percentile, YLL increased consistently with higher temperatures.
   In Vadu, YLL increased in association with heat, whereas in Nairobi, YLL
   increased in association with both low and high temperatures.
   Associations with cold and heat were evident for Phoenix (stronger for
   heat), Stockholm, and Philadelphia (both stronger for cold). Patterns of
   associations with mortality were generally similar to those with YLL.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both high and low temperatures are associated with YLL in
   high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Policy guidance and health
   adaptation measures might be improved with more comprehensive indicators
   of the health burden of high and low temperatures such as YLL.},

Abstract = {Objectives To analyse years of life lost (YLLs) due to digestive
   diseases in Poland according to: marital status, education, working
   status and place of residence.
   Design A cross-sectional study.
   Setting The study was based on a dataset containing information from
   death certificates of Poles who died in 2002 and in 2011.
   Participants The analysis covered records with codes K00-K93 according
   to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health
   Problems, 10th Revision.
   Outcome measures YLL values were calculated using the Standard Expected
   Years of Life Lost measure. For each socioeconomic variable, the rate
   ratio (RR) was calculated as the quotient of YLLs in the less privileged
   group to the more privileged group.
   Results Among the categories of marital status, the smallest YLL values
   (per 10 000) were recorded among singles (men: 100.63 years in 2002,
   121.10 years in 2011; women: 26.99, 33.33, respectively), and the most
   among divorced men (657.87, 689.32) and widowed women (173.97, 169.46).
   YLL analysis according to education level revealed the lowest values in
   people with higher education (men: 54.20, 57.66; women: 17.31, 18.31)
   and the highest in people with lower than secondary education (men:
   178.85, 198.32; women: 104.95, 125.76). Being economically active was
   associated with a smaller YLL score (men: 39.93, 59.51; women: 10.31,
   14.96) than being inactive (men: 340.54, 219.93; women: 126.86, 96.80).
   Urban residents had higher YLL score (men: 159.46, 174.18, women: 73.03,
   78.12) than rural ones (men: 126.83, 137.11, women: 57.32, 57.56). In
   both sexes, RR according to education level and place of residence
   increased, and those according to marital status and working status
   decreased with time.
   Conclusions Activities aimed at reducing health inequalities in terms of
   YLL due to digestive diseases should be primarily addressed to
   inhabitants with lower than secondary education, divorced and widowed
   people, urban residents and those who are economically inactive.},

Title = {The burden of air pollution on years of life lost in Beijing, China,
   2004-08: retrospective regression analysis of daily deaths},
Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Objectives To better understand the burden of air pollution on deaths,
   we examined the effects of air pollutants on years of life lost (YLL) in
   Beijing, China.
   Design Retrospective regression analysis using daily time series.
   Setting 8 urban districts in Beijing, China.
   Participants 80 515 deaths (48 802 male, 31 713 female) recorded by the
   Beijing death classification system during 2004-08.
   Main outcome measures Associations between daily YLL and ambient air
   pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m
   (PM2.5), PM10, SO2, and NO2), after adjusting for long term trends,
   seasonality, day of the week, and weather conditions. We also examined
   mortality risk related to air pollutants.
   Results Mean concentrations of daily PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 were 105.1
   mu g/m(3), 144.6 mu g/m(3), 48.6 mu g/m(3), and 64.2 mu g/m(3),
   respectively. All air pollutants had significant effects on years of
   life lost when we used single pollutant models. An interquartile range
   (IQR) increase in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 was related to YLL increases
   of 15.8, 15.8, 16.2, and 15.1 years, respectively. The effects of air
   pollutants on YLL appeared acutely and lasted for two days (lag 0-1);
   these effects associated with an IQR increase in PM2.5 were greater in
   women than men (11.1 (95\% confidence interval 4.7 to 17.5) v 4.7 (-2.9
   to 12.3) YLL) and in people aged up to 65 years than those older than 65
   years (12.0 (2.9 to 21) v 3.8 (-0.9 to 8.6) YLL). The mortality risk
   associated with an IQR increase in PM2.5 was greater for people older
   than 65 years (2.5\% (95\% confidence interval 0.6\% to 4.5\%) increase
   of mortality) than those aged up to 65 years (0.7\% (-0.8\% to 2.2\%)).
   Conclusions YLL provides a complementary measure for examining the
   effect of air pollutants on mortality. Increased YLL are associated with
   increased air pollution. This study highlights the need to reduce air
   pollution in Beijing, China, to protect the health of the population.},

Title = {Ambient nitrogen dioxide and years of life lost from chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease in the elderly: A multicity study in China},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {275},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading
   cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
   is a potential environmental risk factor for COPD. However, association
   between ambient NO2 and COPD risk remains underrecognized, especially in
   the elderly. This study aimed to explore association between NO2 and
   years of life lost (YLL) from COPD in the elderly from 2013 to 2017 in
   37 major cities in China.
   Methods: Ambient NO2 data and COPD morality information were obtained
   from the National Urban Air Quality Real-time Publishing Platform and
   the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively.
   City-specific relative changes in YLL were estimated by generalized
   additive models, and meta-analysis was used to combine city-specific
   results. Potential modifications were evaluated. Economic loss due to
   excess YLL from COPD associated with ambient NO2 was evaluated.
   Results: An increase of 10 mu g/m(3) in NO2 for 2-day moving average led
   to 0.94\% (95\% CI: 0.56\%, 1.31\%) relative increase in COPD YLL. The
   associations were significantly higher in South than North China. Higher
   estimated effects were found in the warm than the cool season in the
   southern region. The relevant economic loss accounted for 0.04\% (95\%
   CI: 0.02\%, 0.05\%) of the gross domestic product (GDP) in China during
   the same period.
   Conclusions: The findings provide evidence on the impact of short-term
   NO2 exposure on COPD YLL in the elderly, which indicated more stringent
   control of NO2 pollution and highlighted the need to protect the elderly
   during the warm season in South China. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Ambient ozone pollution and years of life lost: Association, effect
   modification, and additional life gain from a nationwide analysis in
   China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {Background: Ozone is one of the dominant air pollutants due to its
   impact on disease burden and increasing trend in concentration. However,
   evidence regarding short-term effect of ozone on years of life lost
   (YLL) is scarce.
   Methods: A national time-series study was conducted in 48 large Chinese
   cities from 2013 to 2017. Generalized additive model coupled with random
   effects model were used to estimate national-average associations of
   ozone with YLL. Potential modifiers and additional life gain due to
   avoidable YLL under certain scenario were also evaluated.
   Results: The average annual mean ozone concentration of these cities was
   86.9 mu g/m(3) . For 10 mu g/m(3) increase in 3-day moving average ozone
   concentration, we estimated 0.37\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI):
   0.29\%, 0.46\%] increase in YLL from nonaccidental causes, 0.38\% (95\%
   CI: 0.30\%, 0.46\%) increase in YLL from cardiovascular diseases, and
   0.36\% (95\% CI: 0.16\%, 0.56\%) increase in YLL from respiratory
   diseases. Moreover, the associations were more evident in people with
   less education and in cities with lower carbon monoxide concentration or
   those located at north region with lower mean temperature. Finally, an
   estimated life of 0.055 (95\% CI: 0.043, 0.068) years would be gained
   per deceased people if ozone concentration could fall to 100 mu g/m(3) .
   Conclusions: Our findings indicated robust associations between
   short-term exposure to ozone and YLL from nonaccidental causes and
   cardiopulmonary diseases. Relevant intervention design should take the
   heterogeneity of both individual- and city-level characteristics into
   account. Implementation of more stringent standard is beneficial for
   alleviating YLL caused by ozone.},

Title = {Prevalence and Years of Life Lost due to Disability from Dental Caries
   among Children and Adolescents in Western China, 1990-2015},

Abstract = {Objective To analyze the prevalence and years lived with disability
   (YLD) from dental caries among children and adolescents and the time
   trends over the past two decades in Sichuan province, the largest
   province in west China.
   Methods Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD2015),
   which systematically assessed the epidemiological characteristics of
   major diseases and their transitions by country and region from 1990 to
   2015, we extracted the estimated results for China. We then used the
   Bayesian meta-regression method to estimate the sex-and age-specific
   prevalences and YLDs from dental caries among children and adolescents
   under 15 years old in Sichuan province and compared them with global and
   national indicators for the same period.
   Results In 2015, there were almost 6 million cases of dental caries in
   children and adolescents (aged < 15 years) in Sichuan province,
   accounting for 6\% of the total cases in China. For children under 5
   years, the prevalence of deciduous caries was 55.9\%, and the YLDs value
   was 10.8 per 100,000, while it was 24.3\% and 5.1 per 100,000
   respectively among 5-to 14-year-olds; for those aged 5 to 14 years, the
   prevalence of permanent caries was 21.5\%, and the YLDs value was 11.5
   per 100,000. From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of dental caries for
   children under 5 years increased substantially, by 16.2\%, and the YLDs
   increased by 8.7\%. Among those aged 5 to 14 years, the prevalence
   increased and the YLDs decreased.
   Conclusion Dental caries remains a huge health burden in Western China.
   In contrast to the global and national data, the trend has increased
   rapidly over the past 25 years in this region. This work provides
   suggestions for the prevention and control for oral health in China with
   the policy of two-child.},

Abstract = {The aims of this study were as follows: to estimate the mortality and
   years of life lost, assessed by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs),
   due to breast cancer attributable to physical inactivity in Brazilian
   women; to compare the estimates attributable to physical inactivity and
   to other modifiable risk factors; and to analyse the temporal evolution
   of these estimates within Brazilian states over 25 years (1990-2015),
   compared with global estimates. Databases from the Global Burden of
   Disease Study for Brazil, Brazilian states, and other parts of the world
   were used. Physical inactivity has contributed to a substantial number
   of deaths (1990: 875; 2015: 2,075) and DALYs (1990: 28,089; 2015:
   60,585) due to breast cancer in Brazil. Physical inactivity was
   responsible for more deaths and DALYs (similar to 12.0\%) due to breast
   cancer than other modifiable risk factors (similar to 5.0\%). The
   Brazilian states with better socioeconomic indicators had higher
   age-standardized rates of mortality and morbidity due to breast cancer
   attributable to physical inactivity. From 1990 to 2015, mortality due to
   breast cancer attributable to physical inactivity increased in Brazil
   (0.77\%; 95\%U.I.: 0.27-1.47) and decreased (-2.84\%; 95\%U.I.: -4.35 -
   -0.10) around the world. These findings support the promotion of
   physical activity in the Brazilian female population to prevent and
   manage breast cancer.},

Title = {Premature mortality in Scottish injecting drug users: a life-history

Abstract = {In Scotland, deaths in drug users are known to be higher than in the
   rest of the UK and most of Europe. Reducing drug-related deaths is
   currently a national priority for the Scottish Government. This study
   aimed to present a description of the life histories of a group of
   injecting drug users who have recently died, with a view to highlighting
   areas for further research. The Edinburgh Addiction Cohort study
   recently carried out 432 follow-up interviews between the years 2005 and
   2007. Thirty-three cases who completed this extensive interview
   detailing early life, education, employment, drug use, opiate
   substitution treatment, criminal history, mental health problems and
   overdose have subsequently died, leaving this source of rich information
   about their lives. The design of the interview used the life grid
   approach. Information was also compiled from full primary care records
   and General Register Office death certificates. Early life adversity was
   apparent for many cases, with a steady progression into early criminal
   behaviour and drug misuse. Poor adult life outcomes illustrated the
   lifelong damaging effects of drug injecting. Death occurred
   significantly earlier than in the general population or those living in
   deprived communities who did not use drugs. In conclusion, a clearer
   understanding of the life histories of problem drug users would be
   advantageous for health-care professionals and policy-makers. More
   qualitative research studies are needed to highlight areas which might
   require early intervention and also complement the existing secondary
   data studies.},

Abstract = {A general equilibrium model is developed in which production of a good
   generates toxic pollution that imposes the risk of premature mortality.
   This risk is reduced to an optimal level by a Pigouvian tax that causes
   consumers to demand less of the polluting good. Whereas the value of
   human life on which courtroom decisions are commonly made is one of lost
   output, in this model the value of human life includes both a lost
   output component and a psychological willingness to pay component.
   Because the dose-response curve for pollution is S shaped and because
   the disparity between the ex ante statistical value of human life and
   the ex post certainty value is likely to be large, the model has special
   implications for Pigouvian taxation.},

Title = {The Burden of Premature Mortality in Turkey in 2001 and 2008},
Journal = {BALKAN MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Background: Standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) is a measure
   that is used to evaluate losses due to premature deaths.
   Aims: The present study provides an analysis of premature mortality in
   Turkey for the years 2001 and 2008 and supplies evidence for making
   policies and setting health agendas over the long term.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Methods: This study calculated SEYLL by gender, age group and causes of
   death in Turkey in 2014. The SEYLL measure counts the years lost in a
   population as a result of premature mortality and is computed by
   multiplying the number of deaths and standard life expectancy at the age
   at which death occurs.
   Results: The burden of premature mortality in Turkey was calculated as 4
   104 253 SEYLL and 4 472 443 SEYLL in 2001 and 2008, respectively. Among
   these 42.7\% and 43.9\% of SEYLL were in females in 2001 and 2008,
   respectively. The leading five causes of premature mortality in the
   Turkish population in 2001 were cardiovascular system diseases
   (34.72\%), perinatal conditions (12.69\%), neoplasms (12.51\%), external
   causes of injury (7.66\%), and infections and parasitic diseases
   (6.57\%). In 2008, the major causes were cardiovascular diseases
   (41.17\%), neoplasms (14.63\%), respiratory system diseases (9.81\%),
   perinatal conditions (5.59\%), and external causes of injury (5.29\%).
   Conclusion: The majority of the burden of premature mortality in Turkey
   is attributable to non-communicable diseases. While premature deaths
   from infections and parasitic diseases, perinatal conditions and
   congenital anomalies decreased between 2001 and 2008, deaths from
   cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory system diseases
   increased dramatically. Coordinated efforts for effective national
   prevention programs (such as regular monitoring of adults for early
   diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and for malignancies by family
   physicians) should be developed by policy makers to decrease preventable
   and premature deaths from non-communicable diseases.},

Title = {Body Mass Index in Young Adulthood, Obesity Trajectory, and Premature
   Mortality},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Although much research has been conducted on the role adult body mass
   index (BMI) plays in mortality, there have been fewer studies that
   evaluated the associations of BMI in young adulthood and adult weight
   trajectory with mortality, and it remains uncertain whether associations
   differ by race or sex. We prospectively examined the relationships of
   BMI in young adulthood (21 years of age) and adult obesity trajectory
   with later-life mortality rates among 75,881 men and women in the
   Southern Community Cohort Study. Study participants were enrolled
   between 2002 and 2009 at ages 40-79 years and were followed through
   December, 2011. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used
   to estimate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. There were
   7,301 deaths in the 474,970 person-years of follow-up. Participants who
   reported being overweight or obese as young adults had mortality rates
   that were 19\% (95\% confidence interval: 12, 27) and 64\% (95\%
   confidence interval: 52, 78) higher, respectively, than those of their
   normal weight counterparts. The results did not significantly differ by
   race or sex. Participants who reported being obese in young adulthood
   only or in both young and middle adulthood experienced mortality rates
   that were 40\%-90\% higher than those of participants who were nonobese
   at either time. These results suggest that obesity in young adulthood is
   associated with higher mortality risk regardless of race, sex, and
   obesity status in later life.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveTo examine mortality and causes of death (CODs) in
   socioeconomically disadvantaged persons with epilepsy (PWEs) in the
   United States.
   MethodsWe performed a retrospective open cohort analysis using Ohio
   Medicaid claims data between 1992 and 2008 to assess mortality and COD
   in 68,785 adult Medicaid beneficiaries with epilepsy. Case fatality
   (CF), mortality rates (MRs), standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and
   years of potential life lost (YPLLs) were calculated. The SMRs were
   estimated to compare risk of death in PWEs with that in the general
   Medicaid population with and without disabilities. Proportionate
   mortality ratios (PMRs), YPLLs, and SMRs for specific COD were also
   obtained.
   ResultsThere were 12,630 deaths in PWEs. CF was 18.4\%, the age-race-sex
   adjusted MR was 18.6/1,000 person-years (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 18.3-18.9). The SMR was 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.8-1.9) when compared to
   the general Medicaid population, and was 1.4 (95\% CI, 1.3-1.6) when
   compared to those with disabilities. The average YPLL was 16.9years
   (range 1-47years). Both epilepsy and comorbid conditions significantly
   contributed to premature mortality in PWEs. Cardiovascular diseases,
   cancer, and unintentional injuries were the most common COD and account
   for a large proportion of YPLLs. Deaths from epilepsy-related causes
   occurred in about 10\% of the cases.
   SignificanceSocioeconomically deprived PWEs, especially young adults,
   experience high mortality and die 17years prematurely. The high
   mortality in Medicaid beneficiaries with epilepsy affirms that comorbid
   conditions and epilepsy play a crucial role in premature death.
   Management of comorbid conditions is, at a minimum, as important as
   epilepsy management, and therefore deserves more attention from
   physicians, particularly those who care for Medicaid beneficiaries with
   epilepsy.},

Abstract = {Chronic non-communicable diseases constitute the highest burden of
   morbidity and mortality in the world and is responsible for 63\% of
   deaths worldwide. In Brazil, they still represent the highest mortality
   in the country. Thus, the objective of the study was to identify areas
   of risk and protection for premature mortality from chronic
   non-communicable diseases according to social vulnerability in the city
   of Ribeirao Preto from 2010 to 2014. This was an ecological,
   quantitative study in which, through the method of spatial scanning, the
   relative risk and 95\% confidence interval were calculated according to
   social vulnerability data. Five areas of statistical significance were
   identified, with two high-risk areas being predominantly of census
   sectors classified as low vulnerability, medium vulnerability, and high
   vulnerability in urban environments, and three protection areas with
   being predominantly of census sectors classified as extremely low
   vulnerability. It was possible to identify areas of risk or protection
   for premature mortality due to CNCDs, which can contribute to the
   development of effective innovative strategies to reduce the burden of
   these diseases for SUS.},

Abstract = {People with epilepsy have an increased risk of premature death. The risk
   is highest soon after onset of seizures. We report the findings of a
   long-term follow-up population-based study of people with epilepsy with
   regards to premature mortality. The National General Practice Study of
   Epilepsy is a prospective study flagged at the National Health Service
   Information Centre in the UK. Over 1000 people with new onset seizures
   were followed from the mid 1980s until April 2009. Of these, 564 people
   were classified at 6 months as having definite epileptic seizures, 228
   as having possible epileptic seizures and 220 as having febrile
   seizures. The remainder were excluded (n = 104 because of an unknown
   prior diagnosis of epilepsy or neonatal seizures) or classified as not
   having epilepsy (n = 79). At median follow-up of 22.8 years there had
   been 301 deaths in the cohort; 300 of these were in people with definite
   or possible seizures. Death certificates were obtained for all but three
   of those who died. The overall standardized mortality ratio for those
   with definite or possible epilepsy was 2.2 (95\% confidence interval
   1.97-2.47), and was higher in those with definite seizures (2.6). In
   those who were alive at 20 years follow-up, the standardized mortality
   ratio in the subsequent years remained significantly elevated (2.2, 95\%
   confidence interval 1.6-3.2). Pneumonia (standardized mortality ratio
   6.6, 95\% confidence incidence 5.1, 8.4) was a common cause of death
   with a consistently elevated standardized mortality ratio throughout
   follow-up. The standardized mortality ratio for ischaemic heart disease
   was significantly elevated for the first time in the last 5 years of
   follow-up (3.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.6-7.0). Few people died from
   epilepsy-related causes. The risk of premature death remains
   significantly elevated at 20-25 years after the index seizure despite
   most of the cohort being in terminal remission (defined as 5 years or
   more seizure-free, on or off anti-epileptic medication) at the last
   follow-up. Further studies are needed to explore the reasons for this
   long-term increase in premature mortality.},

Abstract = {Nearly half of the U.S. adult population will have a major mental
   illness during their lifetimes. At any point in time, almost a fifth of
   all American adults have a serious mental illness (SMI). Too many in our
   society do not understand mental illnesses, placing the blame for the
   illness on those with the illness, resulting in isolation,
   marginalization, or incarceration of individuals with SMIs. They may
   experience stigma, inadequate and delayed health and mental health care,
   and major socioeconomic disadvantages. They may struggle with activities
   of daily living, lose many of their resources, and spiral down into
   poverty. The disadvantages and decreased ability to function experienced
   by individuals with SMIs lead to increased unhealthy behaviors, reduced
   participation in wellness-related activities, and premature morbidity
   and mortality. The general and physical health of individuals with SMIs
   poses greater challenges from both practice and research standpoints.
   However, health educators are poised uniquely to provide health
   promotion programs, conduct research, and advocate for the health and
   well-being of individuals with SMIs. In this review, we summarize the
   challenges and opportunities for health promotion in individuals with
   SMIs.},

Title = {Type A Behavior Pattern is not a Predictor of Premature Mortality},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Background Type A personality was introduced in the 1950s and was
   defined as an action-emotion complex characterized by excessive
   competitive drive, intense striving for achievement, easily provoked
   hostility, aggressiveness, impatience, and exaggerated sense of time
   urgency. Despite many positive findings earlier, almost 50 years of
   studies have not yielded conclusive results regarding Type A as a risk
   factor for negative health outcomes and early death. This may partly be
   due to methodological weaknesses such as small and selected samples,
   short follow-up times, and varying ways to assess Type A across studies.
   Purpose We re-examined the association between the Type A concept with
   cardiovascular (CVD) and non-cardiovascular (non-CVD) mortality by using
   a long follow-up (on average 20.6 years) of a large population-based
   sample of elderly males (N = 2,682), by applying multiple Type A
   measures at baseline, and looking separately at early and later
   follow-up years.
   Method The study sample were the participants of the Kuopio Ischemic
   Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, (KIHD), which includes a randomly
   selected representative sample of Eastern Finnish men, aged 42-60 years
   at baseline in the 1980s. They were followed up until the end of 2011
   through linkage with the National Death Registry. Four self-administered
   scales, Bortner Short Rating Scale, Framingham Type A Behavior Pattern
   Scale, Jenkins Activity Survey, and Finnish Type A Scale, were used for
   Type A assessment at the start of follow-up.
   Result Type A measures were inconsistently associated with
   cardiovascular mortality, and most associations were non-significant.
   Some scales suggested slightly decreased, rather than increased, risk of
   CVD death during the follow-up. Associations with non-cardiovascular
   deaths were even weaker.
   Conclusion Our findings further suggest that there is no evidence to
   support the Type A as a risk factor for CVD and non-CVD mortality.},

Abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) is reported to have the highest premature
   mortality of any psychiatric disorder, but recent meta-analyses may have
   inflated estimates. We sought to re-estimate mortality after
   methodological corrections and to identify predictors of mortality. We
   included 41 cohorts from 40 peer-reviewed studies published between 1966
   and 2010. Methods included double data extraction, log-linear regression
   with an over-dispersed Poisson model, and all-cause and suicide-specific
   standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), with 95\% Poisson confidence
   intervals. Participants with AN were 5.2 {[}3.7-7.5] times more likely
   to die prematurely from any cause, and 18.1 {[}11.5-28.7] times more
   likely to die by suicide than 15-34 year old females in the general
   population. Our estimates were 10\% and 49\% lower, respectively, than
   previously reported SMRs. Risk of premature mortality was highest in
   studies with older participants, although confounding by treatment was
   present. Gender, ascertainment, and diagnostic criteria also impacted
   risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Argentine stem weevil Listronotus bonariensis Kuschel (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae) is an exotic pest of New Zealand ryegrass and the
   adult-stage is parasitized by the introduced solitary endoparasitoid
   Microctonus hyperodae Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Euphorinae). This
   biological control agent is effective, although, under both laboratory
   and field conditions, an unexplained source of premature mortality in
   the weevils is observed after exposure to M. hyperodae. This premature
   mortality may be affected to varying degrees by the length of time of
   parasitoid exposure, the physiological conditions of the host, and the
   host to parasitoid ratios, although it occurs naturally without any
   physical interruption to the parasitoid ovipositional process. In the
   present study, the premature mortality reported in earlier studies is
   confirmed and it is conjectured to be the result of injection of
   parasitoid venom without an egg. Moreover, the lack of premature
   mortality resulting from longer exposure periods indicates that there
   might be a curative effect resulting from subsequent oviposition; the
   egg reverses the toxic effect induced by the injection of venom only. As
   discussed, this phenomenon may not be restricted to the L.
   bonariensis/M. hyperodae system and, accordingly, there are
   evolutionary, biosecurity and general pest management questions to be
   considered.},

Abstract = {Most measures of deprivation concentrate on deprivation among the living
   population and, thus, ignore premature mortality. This omission leads to
   a severe bias in the evaluation of deprivation. We propose two different
   measures that combine information on poverty and premature mortality of
   a population. These measures are consistent and satisfy a number of
   desirable properties unmet by all other measures combining early
   mortality and poverty. Moreover, one measure is readily computable with
   available data and easily interpretable. We show that omitting premature
   mortality leads to an underestimation of total deprivation in 2015 of at
   least 36 percent at the world level.},

Title = {PREMATURE MORTALITY RELATED TO AIDS AMONG MEN AND WOMEN IN CATALONIA},
Journal = {AIDS},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1099-1103},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the mortality pattern observed in relation to
   the AIDS epidemic, and to estimate the current and future demographic
   impact of AIDS among the population aged between 20 and 39 years in
   Catalonia, Spain.
   Design: Spain has the highest cumulative incidence rate of AIDS in
   Europe. One-third of Spanish AIDS cases have been consistently reported
   from Catalonia, an autonomous region in northeastern Spain with a
   population of 6 million, and with Pattern I HIV transmission. In this
   study data from the population-based AIDS registry and death
   certificates in Catalonia were used.
   Methods: Since 1981 AIDS data have been collected routinely from all
   hospitals using an active surveillance system. All causes of death are
   coded from death certificates (ICD-9). Mortality rates since 1981 were
   analysed by age and sex. To assess the relative importance of premature
   mortality due to AIDS, years of potential life lost (YPLL) before age 65
   were used.
   Results: Since 1982 there has been a continuous increase in crude
   mortality rates, particularly significant for men aged 20-39 years after
   1986 (F<0.001). While AIDS was the fourth most likely cause of death
   among people aged 20-39 years in 1988, by 1991 it was the second most
   likely. In 1990 AIDS contributed to 13 213 YPLL (8.7\%) for men and 2579
   YPLL (4\%) for women. During the last few years AIDS-related deaths have
   had the highest mortality rate progression among young adults.
   Conclusion: According to the current available data, AIDS might become
   the leading cause of death for the population aged 20-39 years in the
   near future. AIDS is having an important impact on the demography of
   European countries with Pattern I transmission and high HIV prevalence
   rates.},

Title = {Premature Mortality of 2050 High Bike Use Scenarios in 17 Countries},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biking plays a significant role in urban mobility and has
   been suggested as a tool to promote public health. A recent study has
   pmposed 2050 global biking scenarios based on large shifts from
   motorized vehicles to bikes. No previous studies have estimated the
   health impacts of global cycling scenarios, either future car-bike shift
   substitutions.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify changes in premature mortality of 2050
   global biking scenarios in urban populations from 17 countries.
   METHODS: Through a quantitative Health Impact Assessment, the mortality
   risks and benefits of replacing car trips by bike (mechanica bike and
   electric bike) in urban populations from 17 countries were estimated.
   Multiple bike scenarios were created based on current transport trends
   or large shifts from car trips to bike trips. We quantified the
   estimated change in the number of premature deaths (reduced or
   increased) concerning road traffic fatalities, air pollution, and
   physical activity. This study focuses on urban populations between 20
   and 64 y old.
   RESULTS: We found that, among the urban populations (20-64 y old) of 17
   countries, 205,424 annual premature deaths could be prevented if high
   bike-use scenarios are achieved by 2050 (assuming that 100\% of bike
   trips replace car trips). If only 8\% of bike trips replace car trips in
   a more conservative scenario, 18,589 annual premature deaths could be
   prevented by 2050 in the same population. In all the countries and
   scenarios, the mortality benefits related to bike use (rather than car
   use) outweighed the mortality risks.
   DISCUSSION: We found that global biking policies may provide important
   mortality benefits in 2050. Current and future bike- vs. car-trip
   policies should be considered key public health interventions for a
   healthy urban design.},

Title = {Overall and cause-specific premature mortality in epilepsy: A systematic
   review},
Journal = {EPILEPSY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {213-225},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: We conducted a systematic review to ascertain the overall
   mortality and causes of premature mortality in epilepsy.
   Methodology: We searched PubMed and Embase to identify relevant articles
   reporting mortality in epilepsy. An assessment of the methodological
   quality and overall quality of evidence of the identified studies was
   done using appropriate checklists. We extracted data from these studies
   reporting measures of overall and cause-specific mortality in epilepsy.
   Results: Sixty-three articles from fifty-six cohorts met the eligibility
   criteria, thirty-three population-or community-based and twenty-three
   hospital-or institutional-based studies. The majority of studies are
   from high-income countries (HIC). These studies reported overall excess
   mortality for people with epilepsy, with wide variability reported for
   population-or community-based studies and from low- and middle-income
   countries (LMIC). Twenty-seven articles from twenty-three cohorts
   reported measures of mortality for cause-specific mortality in epilepsy.
   People with epilepsy from HIC and LMIC have a higher risk of dying from
   various causes compared with the general population. Those in LMIC,
   however, have a particularly high chance of dying from external causes
   such as drowning and suicide. We observed a decrement over time in
   measures of overall and cause-specific mortality in cohorts.
   Conclusions: Despite the heterogeneity in reports, our findings support
   the suggestions that people with epilepsy have an increased risk of
   premature mortality from various causes. Further work is needed to
   elucidate the mechanisms, to determine biomarkers for predicting those
   at risk, and to understand the implications of counseling and preventive
   strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {54},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To verify the effect of the Pact for Health on premature
   mortality (30-69 years) attributed to cervical cancer in Brazil and its
   macroregions, using interrupted time series analysis.
   METHODS: Segmented regression was used to assess ``change in level{''}
   and ``change in trend{''} in premature mortality rates attributed to
   cervical cancer considering the post-Pact period (2010-2018),
   controlling by the pre-Pact period (1998-2006). Understanding the
   triennium 2007-2009 as essential for the adoption and implementation of
   the policy, it was excluded from the main modeling, but assessed in the
   sensitivity analysis.
   RESULTS: From 1998 to 2018, there were more than 119,000 deaths due to
   cervical cancer in women aged 30 to 69 years in Brazil. The Northern
   region experienced the highest rates (> 20 per 100,000). Comparing with
   baseline (1998-2006), segmented regression showed a progressive increase
   in changing trend from cervical cancer deaths in Brazil as a whole
   (coefficient = 0.513; 95\%CI 0.430 to 0.596) and in the Southeast region
   (coefficient = 0.515; 95\%CI 0.358 to 0.674), South region (coefficient
   = 0.925; 95\%CI 0.642 to 1.208), and Midwest region (coefficient =
   0.590; 95\%CI 0.103 to 1.077). The Northeast region presented the most
   promising effects with immediate reduction in change level (-0.635;
   95\%CI -1.177 to - 0.092) and progressive reduction in the changing
   trend of premature deaths (coefficient= -0.151; 95\%CI - 0.231 to -
   0.007).
   CONCLUSIONS: Premature mortality rates due to cervical cancer are high
   in Brazil and its macroregions. This interrupted time series was not
   able to reveal the effectiveness of initiatives related to the Pact for
   Health on premature deaths from cervical cancer nationally and in all
   macroregions equally. The best results are restricted to the Northeast
   region.},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity
   and mortality in the United States. Despite substantial declines in CVD
   mortality rates during past decades, progress against cardiovascular
   deaths in midlife has stagnated, with rates increased in some US
   racial/ethnic groups.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the trends in premature (ages 25-64 years)
   mortality from CVD from 2000 to 2015 by demographics and county-level
   factors, including education, rurality, and the prevalence of smoking,
   obesity, and diabetes.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This descriptive study used US
   national mortality data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results data set and included all CVD deaths among individuals ages 25
   to 64 years from January 2000 to December 2015. The data analysis began
   in February 2018.
   EXPOSURES Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and county-level factors.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age-standardized mortality rates and average
   annual percent change (AAPC) in rates by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
   county-level factors (in quintiles) and relative risks of CVD mortality
   across quintiles of each county-level factor.
   RESULTS In 2000 to 2015, 2.3 million CVD deaths occurred among
   individuals age 25 to 64 years in the United States. There were
   significant declines in CVD mortality for black, Latinx, and Asian and
   Pacific Islander individuals (AAPC: range, -1.7 to -3.2\%), although
   black people continued to have the highest CVD mortality rates.
   Mortality rates were second highest for American Indian/Alaskan Native
   individuals and increased significantly among those aged 25 to 49 years
   (AAPC: women, 2.1\%; men, 1.3\%). For white individuals, mortality rates
   plateaued among women age 25 to 49 years (AAPC, 0.05\%). Declines in
   mortality rates were observed for most major CVD subtypes except for
   ischemic heart disease, which was stable in white women and increased in
   American Indian/Alaska Native women, hypertensive heart disease, for
   which significant increases in rates were observed in most racial/ethnic
   groups, and endocarditis, for which rates increased in white individuals
   and American Indian/Alaska Native men. Counties with the highest
   prevalence of diabetes (quintile 5 vs quintile 1: relative risk range
   1.6-1.8 for white individuals and 1.4-1.6 for black individuals) had the
   most risk of CVD mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There have been substantial declines in
   premature CVD mortality in much of the US population. However, increases
   in CVD mortality before age 50 years among American Indian/Alaska Native
   individuals, flattening rates in white people, and overall increases in
   deaths from hypertensive disease suggest that targeted public health
   interventions are needed to prevent these premature deaths.},

Abstract = {Background Non-communicable diseases ( NCDs) have slowly risen to the
   top of the global health agenda and the reduction of premature NCD
   mortality was recently enshrined in Target 3.4 of the UN Sustainable
   Development Goals. The unequal global distribution of NCDs is
   inadequately captured by the most commonly cited statistics.
   Methods We analyzed `WHO Global Health Estimates' mortality data to
   calculate the relative burden of NCDs for each World Bank income group,
   including the `risk of premature NCD death' based on methods in the WHO
   Global Status Report. We included all deaths from cardiovascular
   disease, all cancers, respiratory diseases and diabetes in people aged
   30-69 years.
   Results Developing countries experience 82\% of absolute global
   premature NCD mortality, but they also contain 82\% of the world's
   population. Examining relative risk shows that individuals in developing
   countries face a 1.5 times higher risk of premature NCD death than
   people living in high-income countries. Premature NCD death rates are
   highest in lower middle-income countries.
   Conclusions Although numbers of deaths are useful to describe the
   absolute burden of NCD mortality by country type, the inequitable
   distribution of premature NCD mortality for individuals is more
   appropriately conveyed with relative risk.},

Abstract = {This bottom-up modeling study, supported by new population census 2011
   data, simulates ozone (O-3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure
   on local to regional scales. It quantifies, present-day premature
   mortalities associated with the exposure to near-surface PM2.5 and O-3
   concentrations in India using a regional chemistry model. We estimate
   that PM2.5 exposure leads to about 570,000 (CI95: 320,000-730,000)
   premature mortalities in 2011. On a national scale, our estimate of
   mortality by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to O-3
   exposure is about 12,000 people. The Indo-Gangetic region accounts for a
   large part (similar to 42\%) of the estimated mortalities. The
   associated lost life expectancy is calculated as 3.4 +/- 1.1 years for
   all of India with highest values found for Delhi (6.3 +/- 2.2 years).
   The economic cost of estimated premature mortalities associated with
   PM2.5 and O-3 exposure is about 640 (350-800) billion USD in 2011, which
   is a factor of 10 higher than total expenditure on health by public and
   private expenditure.},

Abstract = {Background: American Indians in South Dakota have the highest mortality
   rates in the nation compared to other racial and ethnic groups and
   American Indians in other states.
   Purpose: Cause-related and age-specific mortality patterns among
   American Indians in South Dakota are identified to guide prevention
   planning and policy efforts designed to reduce mortality within this
   population, in both South Dakota and other parts of the U.S.
   Methods: Death certificate data from South Dakota (2000-2010), on 5738
   American Indians and 70,580 whites, were used to calculate age-specific
   mortality rates and rate ratios. These values were examined in order to
   identify patterns among the leading causes of death. Analyses were
   completed in 2011 and 2012.
   Results: Within the South Dakota population, 70\% of American Indians
   died before reaching age 70 years, compared to 25\% of whites. Fatal
   injuries and chronic diseases were the leading causes of premature
   mortality. Nine leading causes of death showed consistent patterns of
   mortality disparity between American Indians and whites, with American
   Indians having significantly higher rates of mortality at lower ages.
   Conclusions: Premature mortality among American Indians in South Dakota
   is a serious public health problem. Unified efforts at the federal,
   tribal, state, and local levels are needed to reduce premature death
   within this population. (Am J Prev Med 2013;44(5):465-471) (C) 2013

Title = {Serum Total Testosterone and Premature Mortality Among Men in the USA},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UROLOGY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {89-92},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The relationship between testosterone and premature mortality has caused
   recent controversy. While previous studies have demonstrated mixed
   results, this is partly because of variable patient populations,
   different testosterone thresholds, and the use of antiquated techniques
   to measure serum testosterone. Using the National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey we analyzed a cohort representative of men in the USA
   to explore the relationship between serum testosterone and premature
   mortality using contemporary guidelines and testosterone measurements.
   We found that men with low testosterone (<300 ng/dl) were at higher risk
   (odds ratio 2.07, 95\% confidence interval 1.30-3.32; p < 0.01) of
   premature death compared to men with normal testosterone. Furthermore,
   men with low testosterone were also more likely to have treatable
   comorbid conditions that were independently predictive of premature
   mortality. Both testosterone and these comorbid conditions are also
   modulated by lifestyle modifications, rendering this an important
   therapeutic approach in men with either or both conditions.
   Patient summary: We explored the relationship between testosterone
   levels and premature death in a large US population. We found that low
   testosterone is associated with both premature death and related disease
   processes such as obesity, both of which can be initially treated with
   diet and exercise. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Title = {Disparities in Premature Mortality Between High- and Low-Income US
   Counties},
Journal = {PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introduction Several well-established determinants of health are
   associated with premature mortality. Using data from the 2010 County
   Health Rankings, we describe the association of selected determinants of
   health with premature mortality among counties with broadly differing
   levels of income.
   Methods
   County-level data on 3,139 US counties from the 2010 County Health
   Rankings were linked to county mortality data from the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention Compressed Mortality database. We divided
   counties into 3 groups, defined by sample median household income
   levels: low-income (<= 25th percentile, \$29,631), mid-income (25th-75th
   percentile, \$29,631-\$39,401), and high-income (>= 75th percentile,
   >=\$39,401). We analyzed group differences in geographic,
   sociodemographic, racial/ethnic, health care, social, and behavioral
   factors. Stratified multivariable linear regression explored the
   associations of these health determinants with premature mortality for
   high-and low-income groups.
   Results
   The association between income and premature mortality was stronger
   among low-income counties than high-income counties. We found
   differences in the pattern of risk factors between high-and low-income
   groups. Significant geographic, sociodemographic, racial/ethnic, health
   care, social, and behavioral disparities exist among income groups.
   Conclusion
   Geographic location and the percentages of adult smokers and adults with
   a college education were associated with premature mortality rates in US
   counties. These relationships varied in magnitude and significance
   across income groups. Our findings suggest that population health
   policies aimed at reducing mortality disparities require an
   understanding of the socioeconomic context within which modifiable
   variables exist.},

Abstract = {Background and objectives: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
   is responsible for 5.3\% of deaths worldwide and constitutes the third
   most common cause of death. The deaths from this cause occur over
   10times more often in smokers than in non-smokers. Fortunately, for
   nearly 30 years, the proportion of people smoking tobacco in Poland has
   been decreasing. This study aims to analyse the change in premature
   mortality rates of men and women due to COPD in Poland during 2008-2017.
   Materials and Methods: The time trends of deaths occurring under 65 were
   analysed. Standardised premature mortality rates were used, as well as
   the mortality rates for the five-year age ranges, with a breakdown by
   gender. The Joinpoint model was used to determine time trends. Results:
   Over the period analysed, premature mortality in the female population
   decreased by 2.6\% from year to year, albeit without statistical
   significance, and in the male population there was a decrease by
   statistically significant 5.2\% per year. The biggest drop in mortality,
   almost 10\% per year, was observed in the group of females aged between
   50 and 54. Among males, the most significant reduction in mortality was
   observed in groups between the ages of 40 and 54, and it amounted to
   approximately 8\% annually. With increasing age, the dynamics of
   mortality reduction decreased. Conclusions: The study showed a steady
   downward trend in premature mortality due to chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease in Poland in both genders. The reduction in mortality
   was at a high level, despite the lower mortality due to this cause than
   in other European countries.},

Abstract = {Background Substantial disparities in life expectancy exist between
   Chicago's 77 defined community areas, ranging from approximately 69 to
   85 years. Prior work in New York City and Boston has shown that
   community-level racial and economic segregation as measured by the Index
   of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) is strongly related to premature
   mortality. This novel metric allows for the joint assessment of
   area-based income and racial polarisation. This study aimed to assess
   the relationships between racial and economic segregation and economic
   hardship with premature mortality in Chicago.
   Methods Annual age-adjusted premature mortality rates (deaths <65 years)
   from 2011 to 2015 were calculated for Chicago's 77 community areas. ICE
   measures for household income (<US\$25000 vs US\$100 000), race (black
   vs non-Hispanic white), combined ICE measure incorporating income and
   race, and hardship index were calculated from 2015 American Community
   Survey 5-year estimates.
   Results Average annual premature mortality rates ranged from 94 (95\% CI
   61 to 133) deaths per 100000 population age <65 to 699 (95\% CI 394 to
   1089). Compared with the highest ICE quintiles, communities in the
   lowest quintiles had significantly higher rates of premature mortality
   (ICE(Income)rate ratio (RR)=3.06, 95\%CI 2.51 to 3.73; ICERaceRR=3.07,
   95\%CI 2.62 to 3.58; ICEIncome+RaceRR=3.27, 95\%CI 2.84 to 3.77).
   Similarly, compared with communities in the lowest hardship index
   quintile, communities in the highest quintile had significantly higher
   premature mortality rates (RR=2.79, 95\%CI 2.18 to 3.57).
   Conclusions The strong relationships observed between ICE measures and
   premature mortalityparticularly the combined ICE metric encompassing
   race and incomesupport the use of ICE in public health monitoring.},

Title = {Regional variation of premature mortality in Ontario, Canada: a spatial
   analysis},
Journal = {POPULATION HEALTH METRICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {BackgroundPremature mortality is a meaningful indicator of both
   population health and health system performance, which varies by
   geography in Ontario. We used the Local Health Integration Network
   (LHIN) sub-regions to conduct a spatial analysis of premature mortality,
   adjusting for key population-level demographic and behavioural
   characteristics.MethodsWe used linked vital statistics data to identify
   163,920 adult premature deaths (deaths between ages 18 and 74)
   registered in Ontario between 2011 and 2015. We compared premature
   mortality rates, population demographics, and prevalence of
   health-relevant behaviours across 76 LHIN sub-regions. We used Bayesian
   hierarchical spatial models to quantify the contribution of these
   population characteristics to geographic disparities in premature
   mortality.ResultsLHIN sub-region premature mortality rates ranged from
   1.7 to 6.6 deaths per 1000 per year in males and 1.2 to 4.8 deaths per
   1000 per year in females. Regions with higher premature mortality had
   fewer immigrants and higher prevalence of material deprivation, excess
   body weight, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, sedentary
   behaviour, and ever-smoked status. Adjusting for all variables
   eliminated close to 90\% of geographic variation in premature mortality,
   but did not fully explain the spatial pattern of premature mortality in
   Ontario.ConclusionsWe conducted the first spatial analysis of mortality
   in Ontario, revealing large geographic variations. We demonstrate that
   well-known risk factors explain most of the observed variation in
   premature mortality. The result emphasizes the importance of population
   health efforts to reduce the burden of well-known risk factors to reduce
   variation in premature mortality.},

Abstract = {Untreated growth hormone deficiency (GHD) might explain the increased
   mortality reported in patients with hypopituitarism. These statistics
   appear to be largely attributable to cardiovascular disease. Differences
   in fibrinolytic activity regulators, together with dyslipidaemias,
   abdominal obesity and raised blood pressure in hypopituitarism might
   explain this increased risk. There is growing evidence that treatment
   with growth hormone (GH) can rectify most of the cardiovascular
   abnormalities associated with GHD. The reported improved psychosocial
   well-being in response to GH treatment may also be important in lowering
   risk in this group of patients. (C) 1998 Churchill Livingstone.},

Abstract = {Objective: To identify important causes of premature mortality among
   Aboriginal adults in the Northern Territory (NT), 1979-1991.
   Methods: All deaths of NT Aboriginal residents aged 15-64 years which
   occurred in the NT between 1979 and 1991 and which were recorded by the
   Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages were included. Standardised
   mortality ratios (SRnRs) were used to compare the number of deaths
   observed among Aboriginals in the NT to those expected, based on overall
   Australian rates. Years of potential life lost before age 65 (YPLL(65))
   were estimated for specific causes of death.
   Results: Aboriginal women (overall SMR, 5.5) and Aboriginal men (SMR,
   4.7) experienced a high burden of excess mortality from almost every
   cause of death. This excess increased over time, especially for
   Aboriginal women. Among Aboriginal men, the most important causes of
   premature death were motor vehicle accidents (11\% of excess deaths and
   17\% of YPLL(65)), ischaemic heart disease (10\% of excess deaths and
   10\% of YPLL(65)), pneumonia and influenza (8\% of excess deaths and 6\%
   of YPLL(65)), and homicide (7\% of excess deaths and 8\% of YPLL(65)).
   For Aboriginal women, the most important causes included homicide (7\%
   of excess deaths and 11\% of YPLL(65)), chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (10\% of excess deaths and 5\% of YPLL(65)), rheumatic heart
   disease (7\% of excess deaths and 8\% of YPLL(65)), and ischaemic heart
   disease (6\% of excess deaths and 5\% of YPLL(65)).
   Conclusions: The wide variety of causes of excess mortality will require
   an equally wide variety of solutions, both medical and non-medical, and
   a long term commitment will be necessary to achieve reductions in
   premature mortality among NT Aboriginal adults.},

Title = {Production losses associated with premature mortality in 28 European
   Union countries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background There has been a growing interest in the economic burden of
   mortality; however, a majority of evidence is concerned with particular
   diseases. Less is known on the overall cost of all-cause early deaths,
   principally in international context. Therefore, this study aims to
   estimate production losses of premature mortality across 28 European
   Union (EU-28) countries in 2015.
   Methods The human capital method was applied to estimate the production
   losses (indirect costs) of all-cause deaths occurring at working age.
   The sex- and age-specific data on the number of deaths were taken from
   Eurostat's database and a set of labour market measures was used to
   determine time of work during whole lifespan in particular countries.
   Results The total production losses of all-cause premature mortality in
   EU-28 in 2015 were (sic)174.6 billion, adjusted for purchasing power
   parity. The per capita production losses associated with early deaths
   were (sic)342.39 for the whole EU-28 population on average; Lithuania
   experienced the highest per capita burden ((sic)643.68), while the
   average costs were lowest in Greece ((sic)188.69). These figures
   translated to an economic burden of 1.179\% of gross domestic product in
   EU-28 and this share ranged from 0.679\% in Luxembourg to 3.176\% in
   Latvia. Most of the losses were due to men's deaths and the proportion
   of losses associated with male mortality ranged from 64.7\% in the
   Netherlands to 81.2\% in Poland.
   Conclusions Premature mortality is a considerable economic burden for
   European societies; however, the production losses associated with early
   deaths vary notably in particular countries.},

Title = {Evaluation of productivity losses due to premature mortality from
   colorectal cancer},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Cancer is responsible annually for around 27\% of all deaths in Spain,
   15\% of which are caused by colorectal cancer. This malignancy has
   increased its incidence considerably over the past years, which surely
   impacts global productivity losses. The evaluation of lost productivity
   due to premature mortality provides valuable information that guides
   healthcare policies into the establishment of prevention and screening
   programs. The purpose of this study was to assess the productivity
   losses from premature deaths due to colorectal cancer over a ten year
   period (2008-2017). The costs derived from premature mortality due to
   this highly prevalent cancer were estimated using data on mortality,
   age- and sex-specific reference salaries and unemployment rates in Spain
   via the human capital approach. Between 2008 and 2017, 15,103 persons
   died per year from colorectal cancer, representing almost 15\% of all
   cancer-related deaths. Annually, 25,333 years of potential productive
   life were estimated to be lost on average, 14,992 in males and 10,341 in
   females. Productivity losses summed euro510.8 million in in 2017, and
   the cancers of the colon and rectum accounted for 9.6\% of
   cancer-related productivity losses in 2017 in Spain. Colorectal cancer
   has an important weight in terms of productivity losses within the
   Spanish population, consequently, prevention and early detection
   programmes should be promoted and implemented to achieve significant
   reductions in mortality and productivity losses.},

Abstract = {Objective: Determine the relationship between traumatic brain injury
   (TBI.) and premature mortality and intracranial neoplasms occurring 6
   months or more after TBI. Participants: Not applicable. Design:
   Systematic review of the published, peer-reveiwed literature. Primary
   Measures: Not applicable. Results: We identified 23 studies that
   examined premature mortality following TBI and 16 that addressed
   intracranial neoplasms. There was clear evidence of an association
   between penetrating brain injury and premature mortality among patients
   surviving at least 6 months; and similarly compelling evidence of an
   association between moderate or severe TBI and premature mortality among
   patients injured severely enough to require acute rehabilitation. There
   was inadequate evidence to reach a conclusion about whether other closed
   head injuries were associated with premature mortality. For intracranial
   neoplasms, there was an apparent association between TBI and
   intracranial neoplasms diagnosed within 1 year following TBI; however,
   these tumors were likely incidentally found during evaluation for the
   TBI. For tumors diagnosed more than I year post injury, the evidence was
   inadequate to conclude that there was an association, although at least
   1 very large registry-based study found a borderline association.
   Conclusion: More severe TBI (ie, penetrating and moderate and severe TBI
   requiring rehabilitation) is associated with premature mortality among
   patients surviving at least 6 months. There is no clear evidence for an
   association between TBI and intracranial neoplasms presenting more than
   1 year following TBI.},

Title = {Premature mortality projections in the USA through 2030: a modelling

Abstract = {Background Although life expectancy has been projected to increase
   across high-income countries, gains for the USA are anticipated to be
   among the smallest, and overall US death rates actually increased from
   2014 to 2015, with divergence for specific US populations. Therefore,
   projecting future premature mortality is essential for clinical and
   public health service planning, curbing rapidly increasing causes of
   death, and sustaining progress in declining causes of death. We aimed to
   project premature mortality (here defined as deaths of individuals aged
   25-64 years) trends through 2030, and to estimate the total number of
   projected deaths, the projected number of potential years of life lost
   due to premature mortality, and the effect of reducing projected
   accidental death rates by 2\% per year.
   Methods We obtained death certificate data for the US population aged
   25-64 years for 1990-2015 from the US Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics. We obtained US
   mortality data for 2016 for non-American Indian or Alaska native groups
   from CDC WONDER; data for 2016 were not available for American Indians
   or Alaska natives. Our analysis focused on all-cause premature mortality
   and the commonest causes of premature death (cancer, heart disease,
   accidents, suicide, and chronic liver disease or cirrhosis) among white,
   black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific islanders, and American Indian or
   Alaska native men and women. We estimated age-standardised premature
   mortality and corresponding annual percentage changes for 2017-30 by sex
   and race or ethnic origin by use of age-period-cohort forecasting
   models. We also did a sensitivity analysis projecting future mortality
   from cross-sectional mortality and a JoinPoint of the (log) period rate
   ratio curve. We calculated absolute death counts by use of corresponding
   age-specific and year-specific US census population projections, and
   estimated years of potential life lost.
   Findings During 2017-30, all-cause deaths are projected to increase
   among white women and American Indians or Alaska natives, resulting in
   239 700 excess premature deaths relative to 2017 rates (a 10\%
   increase). Mortality declines in white men and black, Hispanic, and
   Asian or Pacific islander men and women will result in 945 900 fewer
   deaths (a 14\% reduction). Cancer mortality rates are projected to
   decline among white, black, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific islander
   women and men, with the largest declines among black women
   (age-standardised premature mortality rate 2016: 104.5 deaths per 100
   000 woman-years; 2030: 77.1 per 100 000 woman-years) and men (2016:
   116.8 per 100 000 man-years; 2030: 81.6 per 100 000 man-years). Heart
   disease death rates are projected to increase in American Indian or
   Alaska native men (2015: 150.9 per 100 000 man-years; 2030: 175.9 per
   100 000 man-years) and decline in other groups, albeit only slightly in
   white (2016: 35.6 per 100 000 woman-years; 2030: 31.1 per 100 000
   woman-years) and American Indian or Alaska native women (2015: 64.4 per
   100 000 woman-years; 2030: 62.8 per 100 000 womanyears). Accidental
   death rates are projected to increase in all US populations except Asian
   or Pacific islander women, and will increase most rapidly among white
   women (2030: 60.5 per 100 000 woman-years) and men (2030: 101.9 per 100
   000 man-years) and American Indian or Alaska native women (2030: 97.5
   per 100 000 woman-years) and men (2030: 298.7 per 100 000 man-years).
   Suicide rates are projected to increase for all groups, and chronic
   liver disease and cirrhosis deaths are projected to increase for all
   groups except black men. A 2\% per year reduction in projected
   accidental deaths would eliminate an estimated 178 700 deaths during
   2017-30.
   Interpretation To reduce future premature mortality, effective
   interventions are needed to address rapidly rising mortality rates due
   to accidents, suicides, and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.

Abstract = {Offenders outside secure settings form an under-researched and
   potentially vulnerable group. This study sought to meta-analytically
   establish whether community offenders, without mental illnesses, die
   prematurely compared to non-offender community and population comparison
   samples. Thirty-six studies met our inclusion criteria (N = 1,116,614).
   Premature mortality is a significant issue for community offenders in
   general (OR = 3.42), and for ex-prisoners in particular (OR = 4.51).
   Offenders were more likely to die from unnatural violent causes (OR =
   3.97) and natural causes (OR = 2.06) than non-offenders, with a
   meta-regression revealing that age was not a significant factor (z =
   -0.01, p = 0.12). These results suggest that the rates of premature
   mortality previously found for offenders do not just reflect the impact
   of mental illness on these individuals, but rather that a life of crime
   may have a significant physiological impact on the body.},

Abstract = {Research shows consistently that social ties are important for
   longevity, and they may be particularly important during adolescence. An
   absence of social ties, or social isolation, during adolescence may
   adversely affect long-term health and wellbeing. While prior research
   has examined associations between isolation from friends and long-term
   health, and having no siblings and mortality, no study (of which we are
   aware) considers jointly both the role of having no friends and no
   siblings, nor more generally with whom adolescents spend time, and the
   risk of premature mortality. This paper extends the literature by
   drawing on data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study to examine the
   association between different types of social isolation during
   adolescence (i.e., an absence of friends, siblings, and time with other
   adolescents) and the risk of premature mortality by midlife. Results
   suggest that having no siblings, being unliked at school, and spending
   (mostly) no time with other adolescents, increases the risk of premature
   mortality. The association between being unliked and premature mortality
   was attenuated by demographic and adolescent characteristics. Consistent
   with our expectations, net of a robust set of covariates, adolescents
   who had no siblings and mostly spent no time with other adolescents
   (i.e., isolates) were the group most vulnerable to premature mortality
   by midlife. However, this was only true for females.},

Abstract = {Background Despite the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type
   2 diabetes associated with excess bodyweight, development of a
   clinically meaningful metric for health professionals remains a
   challenge. We estimated the years of life lost and the life-years lost
   from diabetes and cardiovascular disease associated with excess
   bodyweight.
   Methods We developed a disease-simulation model to estimate the annual
   risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality for people with
   BMI of 25-<30 kg/m(2) (overweight), 30-<35 kg/m(2) (obese), or 35
   kg/m(2) and higher (very obese), compared with an ideal BMI of 18.5-<25
   kg/m(2). We used data from 3992 non-Hispanic white participants in the
   National Nutrition and Examination Survey (2003-10) for whom complete
   risk factor data and fasting glucose concentrations were available.
   After validation of the model projections, we estimated the years of
   life lost and healthy life-years lost associated with each bodyweight
   category.
   Findings Excess bodyweight was positively associated with risk factors
   for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The effect of excess
   weight on years of life lost was greatest for young individuals and
   decreased with increasing age. The years of life lost for obese men
   ranged from 0.8 years (95\% CI 0.2-1.4) in those aged 60-79 years to 5.9
   years (4.4-7.4) in those aged 20-39 years, and years lost for very obese
   men ranged from 0.9 (0-1.8) years in those aged 60-79 years to 8.4
   (7.0-9.8) years in those aged 20-39 years, but losses were smaller and
   sometimes negligible for men who were only overweight. Similar results
   were noted for women (eg, 6.1 years {[}4.6-7.6] lost for very obese
   women aged 20-39 years; 0.9 years {[}0.1-1.7] lost for very obese women
   aged 60-79 years). Healthy life-years lost were two to four times higher
   than total years of life lost for all age groups and bodyweight
   categories.
   Interpretation Our estimations for both healthy life-years and total
   years of life lost show the effect of excess bodyweight on
   cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and might provide a useful health
   measure for discussions between health professionals and their patients.},

Title = {Diabetes free life expectancy and years of life lost associated with
   type 2 diabetes: projected trends in Germany between 2015 and 2040},

Abstract = {Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) causes substantial disease burden and
   is projected to affect an increasing number of people in coming decades.
   This study provides projected estimates of life years free of type 2
   diabetes ( T2D) and years of life lost ( YLL) associated with T2D for
   Germany in the years 2015 and 2040. Methods: Based on an illness-death
   model and the associated mathematical relation between prevalence,
   incidence and mortality, we projected the prevalence of diagnosed T2D
   using currently available data on the incidence rate of diagnosed T2D
   and mortality rates of people with and without diagnosed T2D. Projection
   of prevalence was achieved by integration of a partial differential
   equation, which governs the illness-death model. These projected
   parameters were used as input values to calculate life years free of T2D
   and YLL associated with T2D for the German population aged 40 to 100
   years in the years 2015 and 2040, while accounting for different
   assumptions on future trends in T2D incidence and mortality. Results:
   Assuming a constant incidence rate, women and men at age 40 years in
   2015 will live approximately 38 years and 33 years free of T2D,
   respectively. Up to the year 2040, these numbers are projected to
   increase by 1.0 years and 1.3 years. Assuming a decrease in
   T2D-associated excess mortality of 2\% per year, women and men aged 40
   years with T2D in 2015 will be expected to lose 1.6 and 2.7 years of
   life, respectively, compared to a same aged person without T2D. In 2040,
   these numbers would reduce by approximately 0.9 years and 1.6 years.
   This translates to 10.8 million and 6.4 million YLL in the German
   population aged 40-100 years with prevalent T2D in 2015 and 2040,
   respectively. Conclusions: Given expected trends in mortality and no
   increase in T2D incidence, the burden due to premature mortality
   associated with T2D will decrease on the individual as well as on the
   population level. In addition, the expected lifetime without T2D is
   likely to increase. However, these trends strongly depend on future
   improvements of excess mortality associated with T2D and future
   incidence of T2D, which should motivate increased efforts of primary and
   tertiary prevention.},

Abstract = {The adverse impact of ozone on public health has attracted worldwide
   attention. However, few studies have addressed the contribution of ozone
   to disease burden caused by cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to
   examine the association between short-term ozone exposure and years of
   life lost (YLL) from stroke in 48 Chinese cities. City-specific relative
   change of YLL was estimated by a generalized additive model, then pooled
   using random-effects meta-analysis. The potential effect modification of
   individual, climatic, and city-level characteristics was also evaluated.
   A 10 mu g/m increase in three-day moving average of ozone concentration
   was associated with 0.54\% (95\% CI: 0.41\%, 0.66\%), 0.25\% (95\% CI:
   0.10\%, 0.40\%), and 0.70\% (95\% CI: 0.48\%, 0.92\%) relative increment
   in YLL from stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and ischaemic stroke,
   respectively. The association magnitudes were larger in elderly people,
   females, or higher quartile groups of temperature (all p < 0.01). The
   potential avoidable life lost due to YLL from stroke was 5.5 days per
   deceased person if ozone concentration could reduce to the standard
   recommended by the World Health Organization (100 mu g/m). Our findings
   provided robust evidence on the impact of short-term ozone exposure on
   YLL from stroke and called for more stringent regulation of ozone.},

Abstract = {Objective: Extreme temperature is an important risk factor for
   cardiovascular diseases, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to
   temperature variation. Global warming and the increasingly aging
   population are two major global challenges for human health; thus, an
   urgent need exists to project the temperature-related cardiovascular
   disease burden regarding both of the aforementioned factors. We aimed to
   the project temperature related burden of cardiovascular diseases using
   years of life lost (YLL) in the elderly in a Chinese city with typical
   subtropical climate.
   Methods: A retrospective time-series study was first conducted to
   estimate cardiovascular disease burden associated with temperature in
   the elderly from 2008 to 2015 in Ningbo, China. Then, future projections
   considering demographic change and adaptation under 19 global-scale
   climate models (GCMs) and 3 different Representative Concentration
   Pathways (RCPs) scenarios for the 2050s and 2070s were estimated.
   Results: The exposure-response curve for temperature on YLL from
   cardiovascular diseases was U-shaped, with increased YLL for both
   higher- and lower- than optimal temperature. The projected annual
   increase in heat related YLL was outweighed by the decrease in
   cold-related YLL. However, monthly analysis demonstrated that
   temperature-related YLL will increase significantly in August.
   Additionally, heat-related YLL is projected to increase 3.1-11.5 times
   for the 2050s and 2070s relative to baseline, when considering
   demographic changes, even with 30\% adaptation taken into consideration.
   Conclusions: Although annual YLL from cardiovascular diseases in the
   elderly associated with temperature will decrease in the future,
   heat-related YLL will increase tremendously, which indicates that more
   adaptation strategies and greenhouse emission control measures should be
   undertaken to reduce the future heat-related burden of cardiovascular
   diseases in the elderly.},

Abstract = {Objective We estimate attributable fractions, deaths and years of life
   lost among infants and children l2 years of age due to suboptimal
   breast-feeding in developing countries.
   Design We compare actual practices to a minimum exposure pattern
   consisting of exclusive breast-feeding for infants l6 months of age and
   continued breast-feeding for older infants and children l2 years of age.
   For infants, we consider deaths due to diarrhoeal disease and lower
   respiratory tract infections, and deaths due to all causes are
   considered in the second year of life. Outcome measures are attributable
   fractions, deaths, years of life lost and offsetting deaths potentially
   caused by mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breast-feeding.
   Setting Developing countries.
   Subjects Infants and children 12 years of age.
   Results Attributable fractions for deaths due to diarrhoeal disease and
   lower respiratory tract infections are 55\% and 53\%, respectively, for
   the first six months of infancy, 20\% and 18\% for the second six
   months, and are 20\% for all-cause deaths in the second year of life.
   Globally, as many as 1.45 million lives (117 million years of life) are
   lost due to suboptimal breast-feeding in developing countries.
   Offsetting deaths caused by mother-to-child transmission of HIV through
   breast-feeding could be as high as 242 000 (18.8 million years of life
   lost) if relevant World Health Organization recommendations are not
   followed.
   Conclusions The size of the gap between current practice and
   recommendations is striking when one considers breast-feeding involves
   no out-of-pocket costs, that there exists universal consensus on best
   practices, and that implementing current international recommendations
   could potentially save 1.45 million children's lives each year.},

Title = {Utilizing daily excessive concentration hours to estimate cardiovascular
   mortality and years of life lost attributable to fine particulate matter
   in Tehran, Iran},

Abstract = {Background: Evidence for associations between fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in Iran is scarce. Given
   large within-day variations of PM2.(5) concentration, using the daily
   mean of PM2.5 (PM(2.5)mean) as exposure metric might bias the
   health-related assessment. This study applied a novel indicator, daily
   excessive concentration hours (DECH), to evaluate the effect of ambient
   PM2.5 on CVD mortality and years of life lost (YLL) in Tehran, the
   capital city of Iran.
   Methods: Hourly concentration data for PM2.5, daily information for
   meteorology and records of registered cardiovascular deaths from 2012 to
   2016 were obtained from Tehran, Iran. Daily excessive concentration
   hours of PM2.5 (PM2.5DECH) was defined as daily total
   concentration-hours exceeding 35 mu g/m(3). Using a time-series design,
   we applied generalized linear models to assess the attributable effects
   of PM2.5DECH and PM(2.5)mean on CVD mortality and YLL.
   Results: For an interquartile range (IQR) rise in PM2.5DECH, total CVD
   mortality at lag 0-10 days and YLL at lag 0-8 days increased 2.26\%
   (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-3.69\%) and 23.24 (6.07-40.42)
   person years, respectively. Corresponding increases were 3.45\%
   (1.44-5.49\%) and 35.21 (10.85-59.58) person years for an IQR rise in
   PM(2.5)mean. Significant associations between PM2.5 pollution (i.e.,
   PM(2.5)mean and PM2.5DECH) and cause-specific cardiovascular health
   (i.e., mortality and YLL) were only identified in stroke. Subgroup
   analyses showed that male and people aged 0-64 years suffered more from
   PM2.5 pollution. Furthermore, we attributed a greater CVD burden to
   PM2.5DECH (1.67\% for mortality and 2.67\% for YLL) than PM2.5mean
   (0.63\% for mortality and 0.70\% for YLL) during the study period.
   Conclusions: This study strengthened the evidence for the aggravated CVD
   mortality burden associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5. Our
   findings also suggested that PM2.5DECH might be a potential alternative
   indicator of exposure assessment in PM2.5-related health investigations.

Abstract = {Introduction
   Alzheimer's disease patients are reported to have higher survival rate
   compared to patients with vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy
   bodies. There is a paucity of studies investigating survival including
   persons with cognitive decline and dementia of various aetiologies.
   Objectives
   We aimed to compare survival for patients with subjective cognitive
   decline, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular
   dementia, mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy
   bodies/Parkinson's disease, and other dementias compared to the general
   Norwegian population, taking into account the role of gender, cognitive
   function, function in everyday activities, comorbidity and education.
   Methods
   Patients (N = 4682), >= 65 years, in the The Norwegian register of
   persons assessed for cognitive symptoms (NorCog) during 2009-2017 were
   followed for mortality in the National Registry until January 2018.
   Flexible parametric survival models were applied to estimate relative
   survival, life expectancy and years of life lost for diagnostic groups
   compared with the general population.
   Results
   Patients with vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's
   had the shortest survival, followed by mixed dementia, Alzheimer's
   disease, unspecified dementia, mild cognitive impairment and subjective
   cognitive decline. At age 70 years, men with vascular dementia or
   dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's had life expectancy of 4.7 years,
   which corresponded to 10.3 years of life lost compared to the general
   population. Years of life lost for other diagnoses were 10.0 years for
   mixed dementia, 9.2 years for Alzheimer's disease, 9.3 years for other
   dementias, 5.2 years for mild cognitive impairment and 2.2 years for
   subjective cognitive decline. Corresponding years of life lost in women
   were: 12.7 years, 10.5 years, 9.8 years, 10.6 years, 7.8 years, and 2.6
   years. Poor relative survival among dementia patients was associated
   with male gender, comorbidity, low cognitive function, and low function
   in activities of daily living.
   Conclusions
   Compared with the general population, patients with subjective cognitive
   decline had no significant loss in life expectancy, while patients with
   mild cognitive impairment and all dementia subtypes had large losses,
   especially those with a diagnosis of vascular dementia or dementia with
   Lewy bodies/Parkinson's.},

Abstract = {Weather extremes are associated with adverse health outcomes, including
   mortality. Studies have investigated the mortality risk of temperature
   in terms of excess mortality, however, this risk estimate may not be
   appealing to policy makers assessing the benefits expected for any
   interventions to be adopted. To provide further evidence of the burden
   of extreme temperatures, we analyzed the effect of temperature on years
   of life lost (YLL) due to all-cause mortality among the population in
   two urban informal settlements. YLL was generated based on the life
   expectancy of the population during the study period by applying a
   survival analysis approach. Association between daily maximum
   temperature and YLL was assessed using a distributed lag nonlinear
   model. In addition, cold spell and heat wave effects, as defined
   according to different percentiles, were investigated. The
   exposure-response curve between temperature and YLL was J-shaped, with
   the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) of 26 degrees C. An average
   temperature of 21 degrees C compared to the MMT was associated with an
   increase of 27.4 YLL per day (95\% CI, 2.7-52.0 years). However, there
   was no additional effect for extended periods of cold spells, nor did we
   find significant associations between YLL to heat or heat waves.
   Overall, increased YLL from all-causes were associated with cold spells
   indicating the need for initiating measure for reducing health burdens.},

Abstract = {The present study was conducted to compare the impact of heat waves on
   mortality and years of life lost (YLL) in Kerman, Iran during the years
   2005-2017. Daily mean temperature in a combination of intensity and
   duration were used in order to define heat waves (90, 95, and 98th
   percentile and >= 2, 3, and 4 consecutive days). YLL was calculated
   according to Iran's life table and by considering the discount rate. In
   order to investigate the impact of heat waves in different lags and its
   cumulative effect on mortality and YLL, Poisson and linear models within
   distributed lag nonlinear models were used respectively. A maximum lag
   of 14 days was considered. The best model was selected based on AIC
   (Akaike Information Criteria). The model was adjusted for air
   pollutants, public holidays, days of the week, and humidity. The average
   daily mortality and YLL were 10.54 +/- 4.31 deaths and 175.58 +/- 91.39
   years respectively. They were higher in men and in heat waves matching a
   definition of above the 98th temperature percentile and >= 3 days, than
   others. Except heat waves defined as the 98th percentile and >= 4 days,
   the impact of heat waves on mortality and YLL were the highest at lag 0.
   The cumulative relative risk of total mortality was significantly higher
   in heat waves above the 95 and 98th percentiles. The cumulative effect
   of heat waves on total YLL was significantly higher only above the 98th
   percentile. Men over 65 years old were the most vulnerable and had the
   highest mortality and YLL. Heat waves with temperatures above the 98th
   percentile that lasted at least 2 or 3 consecutive days had a
   significant effect in increasing both total YLL and mortality in Kerman,
   Iran.},

Abstract = {Due to the significant socioeconomic burden of kidney diseases, we
   decided to analyse years of life lost (YLLs) from this cause in Poland
   between the years 2000 and 2019. The standard expected years of life
   lost (SEYLL) measure was used to calculate the number of YLLs, the value
   of which was related to the size of the study population and calculated
   per 100,000 persons (SEYLLp). A time trend analysis was performed using
   the Joinpoint regression method. In 2000, the number of YLLs for the
   entire population was 72,795 (SEYLLp = 190.3 years). After a period of
   minor changes between 2000 and 2011 (increasing at 0.9\% per year), the
   YLL index rapidly declined between 2011 and 2015 (at -15.4\% yearly) and
   then increased in the last years of the study period (at 12.5\% yearly).
   These changes resulted in a decrease in the number of YLLs to 57,278 in
   2019 (SEYLLp = 149.2). The deteriorating health status of Poles after
   2015 most likely was caused by the aging of the population, as well as
   the increasing incidence of risk factors, in particular diabetes and
   arterial hypertension.},

Abstract = {Objective: Ambient ozone is one of the most important air pollutants
   with respect to its impacts on human health and its increasing
   concentrations globally. However, studies which explored the burden of
   ozone pollution on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
   estimated the relevant economic loss were rare.
   Objective: We explored the relationships between ambient ozone exposure
   and years of life lost (YLL) from COPD mortality and estimated the
   relevant economic loss in Ningbo, in the Yangtze River Delta of China,
   2011-2015.
   Methods: A time-series study was conducted to explore the effects of
   ozone on YLL from COPD. Seasonal stratified analyses were performed, and
   the effect modification of demographic factors was estimated. In
   addition, the related economic loss was calculated using the method of
   the value per statistical life year (VSLY).
   Results: Averaged daily mean maximum 8-h average ozone concentration was
   40.90 ppb in Ningbo, China, 2011-2015. The effect of short term ambient
   ozone exposure on COPD YLL was more pronounced in the cool season than
   in the warm season, with 10 ppb increment of ozone corresponding to
   7.09(95\% CI: 3.41, 10.78) years increase in the cool season and 0.31
   (95\%CI: -2.15, 2.77) years change in the warm season. The effect was
   higher in the elderly than the young. Economic loss due to excess COPD
   YLL related to ozone exposure accounted for 7.30\% of the total economic
   loss due to COPD YLL in Ningbo during the study period.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight that ozone exposure was related to
   tremendous disease burden of COPD in Ningbo, China. The effects were
   more pronounced in the cool season, and the elderly were more
   susceptible populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objective: To estimate the long-term productivity impacts of all-cause
   premature mortality in Australia by age, sex and cause of death.
   Methods: Using a human capital approach, a model was developed to
   estimate both the working years and present value of lifetime income
   (PVLI) lost due to premature deaths that occurred in 2003. Outcomes were
   modelled on individual level data to the year 2030. A discount rate of
   3\% was applied and results are presented in 2015 Australian dollars.
   Results: Premature deaths occurring in 2003 accounted for about 284,000
   working years lost and \$13.8 billion in PVLI lost when modelled to
   2030. Deaths from cancer and cardiovascular disease accounted for more
   than half the total PVLI impact. Injuries and mental disorders were
   associated with the highest average PVLI loss per death. Conclusions:
   The productivity-related impacts of premature mortality are substantial.
   This study provides an assessment of relative impact of these costs
   across specific age, sex and cause of death categories. Implications:
   Policies and interventions that prevent premature mortality would
   improve both health and economic outcomes. An awareness of the
   productivity costs associated with all-cause mortality may assist
   decision makers in identifying population and disease subgroups where
   cost-effective health care investment can achieve the greatest economic
   gains to society.},

Abstract = {In recent years, sex differences in mortality have followed diverse
   patterns of change in developed countries. As there is no analogous
   evidence from Poland, the aim of this study was to describe the pattern
   of change in excess male mortality among Polish inhabitants aged 35-64
   during 19952002, when the major socioeconomic transformation occurred,
   and compare it with sex differences in mortality observed in the late
   1980s. During the study period, excess male mortality decreased
   significantly, independently of age and educational level. The reduction
   in mortality was observed in both sexes, but its magnitude was greater
   in men. These changes resulted mainly from a reduction in mortality
   rates due to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer in males and a
   concomitant increase in mortality rates due to lung cancer and suicides
   in females. Although, in general, excess male mortality decreased,
   social gradients related to this phenomenon increased. Subjects (in
   particularly men) who had graduated from university benefited the most,
   their magnitude of reduction in mortality rates being the greatest.
   Changes in social environment during the transformation period in Poland
   are suggested as major determinants of these changes, but further
   studies are needed.},

Title = {Estimation of premature mortality from oral cancer in Japan, 1995 and

Journal = {CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Background: To better understand the picture of premature death from
   oral cancer, we estimated years of life lost (YLL) and average years of
   life lost (AYLL) of this cancer for the years 1995 and 2005 in Japan.
   Methods: We obtained the mortality data for 5-year age groups from the
   Vital Statistics of Japan for the years 1995 and 2005, an interval of 10
   years. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100,000 persons were calculated
   for each subset of oral cancer. We estimated YLL and AYLL according to
   life tables in Japan to reflect premature mortality. Results: For both
   men and women combined, 4099 and 5679 deaths due to oral cancer were
   recorded for the years 1995 and 2005. In men, cancer of tongue,
   oropharynx, and hypopharynx were the most frequently observed anatomic
   sites. We observed a total of 51,339.1 years of life lost in 1995 and
   68,630.4 years in 2005, corresponding to an overall AYLL for all oral
   cancer deaths combined of 17.2 and 16.5 years earlier than life
   expectancy, respectively. The greatest AYLL was seen for deaths from
   nasopharyngeal cancer, with AYLL of 21.1 years in 1995 and 20.3 years in
   2005. In women, cancer of the tongue and gum were the most affected
   anatomic sites. Total numbers of YLL were 18,884.8 years in 1995 and
   24,765.7 in 2005, corresponding to an overall AYLL of 16.9 and 16.2
   years earlier than life expectancy. The greatest AYLL was seen for
   deaths from nasopharyngeal cancer, with AYLL of 22.4 years and 20.4
   years in 1995 and 2005, respectively. Conclusion: The present study
   shows that cancer of pharynx, tongue, and gum were the most frequent
   oral cancers in both sexes in both 1995 and 2005, and responsible for a
   remarkable number of years of life expectancy lost. Deaths due to those
   cancer sites occurred about 16-21 years earlier than expected in men,
   and 14-22 years in women. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The unclosing premature mortality gap in gout: a general
   population-based study},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES},

Abstract = {Objective Gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis, is associated
   with premature mortality. Whether this mortality gap has improved over
   time, as observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is unknown.
   Methods Using an electronic medical record database representative of
   the UK general population, we identified incident gout cases and
   controls between 1999 and 2014. The gout cohort was divided based on
   year of diagnosis into early (1999-2006) and late (2007-2014) cohorts.
   We compared the mortality rates and HRs, adjusting for potential
   confounders between the cohorts. We conducted sensitivity analyses among
   patients with gout who received at least one prescription for
   urate-lowering therapy, which has been found to have a validity of 90\%.
   Results In both cohorts, patients with gout showed similar levels of
   excess mortality compared with their corresponding comparison cohort
   (ie, 29.1 vs 23.5 deaths/1000 person-years and 23.0 vs 18.8 deaths/1000
   person-years in the early and late cohorts, respectively). The
   corresponding mortality HRs were 1.25 (95\% CI 1.21 to 1.30) and 1.24
   (95\% CI 1.20 to 1.29), and the multivariable HRs were 1.10 (95\% CI
   1.06 to 1.15) and 1.09 (95\% CI 1.05 to 1.13), respectively (both p
   values for interaction >0.72). Our sensitivity analyses showed similar
   findings (both p values for interaction >0.88).
   Conclusions This general population-based cohort study indicates that
   the level of premature mortality among patients with gout remains
   unimproved over the past 16 years, unlike RA during the same period.
   This unclosing premature mortality gap calls for improved management of
   gout and its comorbidities.},

Title = {Inequalities in premature mortality in Britain: observational study from
   1921 to 2007},
Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {341},

Abstract = {Objective To report on the extent of inequality in premature mortality
   as measured between geographical areas in Britain.
   Design Observational study of routinely collected mortality data and
   public records. Population subdivided by age, sex, and geographical area
   (parliamentary constituencies from 1991 to 2007, pre-1974 local
   authorities over a longer time span).
   Setting Great Britain.
   Participants Entire population aged under 75 from 1990 to 2007, and
   entire population aged under 65 in the periods 1921-39, 1950-3, 1959-63,
   1969-73, and 1981-2007.
   Main outcome measure Relative index of inequality (RII) and ratios of
   inequality in age-sex standardised mortality ratios under ages 75 and
   65. The relative index of inequality is the relative rate of mortality
   for the hypothetically worst-off compared with the hypothetically
   best-off person in the population, assuming a linear association between
   socioeconomic position and risk of mortality. The ratio of inequality is
   the ratio of the standardised mortality ratio of the most deprived 10\%
   to the least deprived 10\%.
   Results When measured by the relative index of inequality, geographical
   inequalities in age-sex standardised rates of mortality below age 75
   have increased every two years from 1990-1 to 2006-7 without exception.
   Over this period the relative index of inequality increased from 1.61
   (95\% confidence interval 1.52 to 1.69) in 1990-1 to 2.14 (2.02 to 2.27)
   in 2006-7. Simple ratios indicated a brief period around 2001 when a
   small reduction in inequality was recorded, but this was quickly
   reversed and inequalities up to the age of 75 have now reached the
   highest levels reported since at least 1990. Similarly, inequalities in
   mortality ratios under the age of 65 improved slightly in the early
   years of this century but the latest figures surpass the most extreme
   previously reported. Comparison of crudely age-sex standardised rates
   for those below age 65 from historical records showed that geographical
   inequalities in mortality are higher in the most recent decade than in
   any similar time period for which records are available since at least
   1921.
   Conclusions Inequalities in premature mortality between areas of Britain
   continued to rise steadily during the first decade of the 21st century.
   The last time in the long economic record that inequalities were almost
   as high was in the lead up to the economic crash of 1929 and the
   economic depression of the 1930s. The economic crash of 2008 might
   precede even greater inequalities in mortality between areas in Britain.},

Title = {Premature Mortality Among Patients Recently Discharged From Their First
   Inpatient Psychiatric Treatment},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Nationwide cohorts provide sufficient statistical power for
   examining premature, cause-specific mortality in patients recently
   discharged from inpatient psychiatric services.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate premature mortality in a nationwide cohort of
   patients recently discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment at
   ages 15 to 44 years.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-cohort design included all
   persons born in Denmark (N = 1 683 385) between January 1, 1967, and
   December 31, 1996. Exactly 48 599 of these Danish residents were
   discharged from an inpatient psychiatric unit or ward on or after their
   15th birthday, which took place during this study's observation period
   from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 2011. This group of patients
   was followed up beginning on their 15th birthday until their death,
   emigration, or December 31, 2011, whichever came first. Individuals
   discharged from inpatient psychiatric care at least once before their
   15th birthday (n = 5882) were excluded from the study. All data were
   obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System, Psychiatric Central
   Research Register, and Register of Causes of Death. Data analysis took
   place between February 1, 2016, and December 10, 2016.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios
   (IRRs) for all-cause mortality and for an array of unnatural and natural
   causes of death among patients recently discharged from an inpatient
   psychiatric unit vs persons not admitted to a psychiatric facility.
   Primary analysis considered risk within the year of first discharge.
   RESULTS Of the 48 599 discharged patients who were included in the
   study, 25 006 (51.4\%) were female, 35 660 (73.4\%) were aged 15 to 29
   years, and 33 995 (70.0\%) had a length of stay of 30 days or less.
   Compared with persons not admitted, patients discharged had an elevated
   risk for all-cause mortality within 1 year (IRR, 16.2; 95\% CI,
   14.5-18.0). The relative risk for unnatural death (IRR, 25.0; 95\% CI,
   22.0-28.4) was much higher than for natural death (IRR, 8.6; 95\% CI,
   7.0-10.7). The highest IRR found was for suicide at 66.9 (95\% CI,
   56.4-79.4), followed by alcohol-related death at 42.0 (95\% CI,
   26.6-66.1). Among the psychiatric diagnostic categories assessed,
   psychoactive substance abuse conferred the highest risk for all-cause
   mortality (IRR, 24.8; 95\% CI, 21.0-29.4). Across the array of
   cause-specific outcomes examined, risk of premature death during the
   first year after discharge was markedly higher than the risk of death
   beyond the first year of discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinicians may help protect patients after
   discharge by serving as a liaison between primary and secondary health
   services to ensure they are receiving holistic care. Early intervention
   programs for drug and alcohol misuse could substantially decrease the
   greatly elevated mortality risk among these patients.},

Title = {Increased premature mortality of competitive powerlifters suspected to

Abstract = {Misuse of supraphysiological doses of anabolic steroids is claimed to
   have serious side effects. The aim of the study was to determine the
   mortality, and the cause of premature deaths among a group of subjects
   who are strongly suspected to have used anabolic steroids for a
   non-medical purpose over several years. The mortality of 62 male
   powerlifters placed 1st-5th in weight series 82.5-125 kg in Finnish
   championships during 1977-1982 was compared with the mortality of
   population controls. The mortality during the 12-year follow-up was
   12.9\% for the powerlifters compared to 3.1\% in the control population.
   By 1993 eight of 62 powerlifters and 34 of 1094 population controls had
   died, thus the risk of death among the powerlifters was 4.6 timer higher
   (95\% CI 2.04-10.45; p = 0.0002). The causes of premature death among
   the powerlifters were suicide (3), acute myocardial infarction (3),
   hepatic coma (1) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1). These findings add to
   the growing amount of evidence of an association between anabolic
   steroid abuse and premature death, and support the view that measures to
   decrease AAS misuse among both competitive and amateur athletes are
   justified.},

Title = {Impact of Summer Heat on Urban Population Mortality in Europe during the
   1990s: An Evaluation of Years of Life Lost Adjusted for Harvesting},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Background: Efforts to prevent and respond to heat-related illness would
   benefit by quantifying the impact of summer heat on acute population
   mortality. We estimated years of life lost due to heat in 14 European
   cities during the 1990s accounting for harvesting.
   Methods: We combined the number of deaths attributable to heat estimated
   by the PHEWE project with life expectancy derived from population life
   tables. The degree of harvesting was quantified by comparing the
   cumulative effect of heat up to lagged day 30 with the immediate effect
   of heat, by geographical region and age. Next, an evaluation of years of
   life lost adjusted for harvesting was obtained.
   Results: Without accounting for harvesting, we estimated more than
   23,000 years of life lost per year, 55\% of which was among individuals
   younger than 75. When 30 day mortality displacement was taken into
   account, the overall impact reduced on average by 75\%. Harvesting was
   more pronounced in North-continental cities than in Mediterranean cities
   and was stronger among young people than among elderly.
   Conclusions: High ambient temperatures during summer were responsible
   for many deaths in European cities during the 1990s, but a large
   percentage of these deaths likely involved frail persons whose demise
   was only briefly hastened by heat exposure. Differences in harvesting
   across regions and classes of age could reflect different proportions of
   frail individuals in the population or could be indicative of
   heterogeneous dynamics underlying the entry and exit of individuals from
   the high-risk pool which is subject to mortality displacement.},

Abstract = {Background: There is growing evidence that chronic exposure to
   transportation related noise and air pollution affects human health.
   However, health burden to a country of these two pollutants have been
   rarely compared.
   Aims: As an input for external cost quantification, we estimated the
   cardiorespiratory health burden from transportation related noise and
   air pollution in Switzerland, incorporating the most recent findings
   related to the health effects of noise.
   Methods: Spatially resolved noise and air pollution models for the year
   2010 were derived for road, rail and aircraft sources. Average
   day-evening-night sound level (Lden) and particulate matter (PM10) were
   selected as indicators, and population-weighted exposures derived by
   transportation source. Cause-specific exposure-response functions were
   derived from a meta-analysis for noise and literature review for PM10.
   Years of life lost (YLL) were calculated using life table methods;
   population attributable fraction was used for deriving attributable
   cases for hospitalisations, respiratory illnesses, visits to general
   practitioners and restricted activity days.
   Results: The mean population weighted exposure above a threshold of 48
   dB(A) was 8.74 dB(A), 1.89 dB(A) and 0.37 dB(A) for road, rail and
   aircraft noise. Corresponding mean exposure contributions were 4.4,
   0.54, 0.12 mu g/m(3) for PM10. We estimated that in 2010 in Switzerland
   transportation caused 6000 and 14,000 YLL from noise and air pollution
   exposure, respectively. While there were a total of 8700
   cardiorespiratory hospital days attributed to air pollution exposure,
   estimated burden due to noise alone amounted to 22,500 hospital days.
   Conclusions: YLL due to transportation related pollution in Switzerland
   is dominated by air pollution from road traffic, whereas consequences
   for morbidity and indicators of quality of life are dominated by noise.
   In terms of total external costs the burden of noise equals that of air
   pollution. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effect of substance use on premature mortality among severely
   hypertensive African Americans},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL HYPERTENSION},
Abstract = {Low-income African Americans residing in impoverished neighborhoods
   confront myriad barriers to adhering to antihypertensive regimens.
   Substance use may thwart medication adherence and lifestyle modification
   efforts, which has implications for excess cardiovascular disease
   mortality. The Inner-City Hypertension and Body Organ Damage (ICHABOD)
   Study was a longitudinal cohort study that evaluated causes of mortality
   among African Americans who lived in urban areas, had severe, poorly
   controlled hypertension, and were admitted to a local hospital between
   1999-2001 and 2002-2004. The authors employed Cox proportional hazards
   models to assess mortality associated with illicit substance use,
   including use of heroin and cocaine, as well as by use of tobacco and
   alcohol. Among192 participants with poorly controlled hypertension, 30\%
   were active illicit substance users (specifically, 22.7\% heroin users,
   19.8\% were cocaine users, and 30.7\% were both cocaine and heroin
   users). The mean age among substance non-users was 52.3 years versus
   48.7 years among those reporting current use. Mortality over 7.6 years
   of follow-up was 52.5\% among substance users and 33.8\% among nonusers
   (p-value, 0.01). After adjusting for potential confounders, the hazard
   ratio (HR) for cocaine use was 2.52 (95\% confidence interval (CI)
   1.38-4.59), while the HR for heroin use was 2.47 (95\% CI 1.42-4.28) and
   the HR for both was 2.75 (95\% CI 1.60-4.73). Substance use was
   associated with increased mortality among urban black Americans with
   poorly controlled hypertension. These data suggest the need for targeted
   interventions to support African Americans who have poorly controlled
   hypertension and use illicit substances, as a means of reducing excess
   mortality.},

Title = {How to measure premature mortality? A proposal combining ``relative{''}
   and ``absolute{''} approaches},
Journal = {POPULATION HEALTH METRICS},

Abstract = {Background The concept of ``premature mortality{''} is at the heart of
   many national and global health measurement and benchmarking efforts.
   However, despite the intuitive appeal of its underlying concept, it is
   far from obvious how to best operationalise it. The previous work offers
   at least two basic approaches: an absolute and a relative one. The
   former-and far more widely used- approach sets a unique age threshold
   (e.g. 65 years), below which deaths are defined as premature. The
   relative approach derives the share of premature deaths from the
   country-specific age distribution of deaths in the country of interest.
   The biggest disadvantage of the absolute approach is that of using a
   unique, arbitrary threshold for different mortality patterns, while the
   main disadvantage of the relative approach is that its estimate of
   premature mortality strongly depends on how the senescent deaths
   distribution is defined in each country. Method We propose to overcome
   some of the downsides of the existing approaches, by combining features
   of both, using a hierarchical model, in which senescent deaths
   distribution is held constant for each country as a pivotal quantity and
   the premature mortality distribution is allowed to vary across
   countries. In this way, premature mortality estimates become more
   comparable across countries with similar characteristics. Results The
   proposed hierarchical models provide results, which appear to align with
   related evidence from specific countries. In particular, we find a
   relatively high premature mortality for the United States and Denmark.
   Conclusions While our hybrid approach overcomes some of the problems of
   previous measures, some issues require further research, in particular
   the choice of the group of countries that a given country is assigned to
   and the choice of the benchmarks within the groups. Hence, our proposed
   method, combined with further study addressing these issues, could
   provide a valid alternative way to measure and compare premature
   mortality across countries.},

Title = {Socioeconomic Position and Premature Mortality in the AusDiab Cohort of
   Australian Adults},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {106},
Number = {3},
Pages = {470-477},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives. To determine the association of socioeconomic position
   indicators with mortality, without and with adjustment for modifiable
   risk factors.
   Methods. We examined the relationships of 2 area-based indices and
   educational level with mortality among 9338 people (including 8094
   younger than 70 years at baseline) of the Australian Diabetes Obesity
   and Lifestyle (AusDiab) from 1999-2000 until November 30, 2012.
   Results. Age-and gender-adjusted premature mortality (death before age
   70 years) was more likely among those living in the most disadvantaged
   areas versus least disadvantaged (hazard ratio {[}HR] = 1.48; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.08, 2.01), living in inner regional
   versus major urban areas (HR = 1.36; 95\% CI = 1.07, 1.73), or having
   the lowest educational level versus the highest (HR = 1.64; 95\% CI =
   1.17, 2.30). The contribution of modifiable risk factors (smoking
   status, diet quality, physical activity, stress, cardiovascular risk
   factors) in the relationship between 1 area-based index or educational
   level and mortality was more apparent as age of death decreased.
   Conclusions. The relation of area-based socioeconomic position to
   premature mortality is partly mediated by behavioral and cardiovascular
   risk factors. Such results could influence public health policies.},

Abstract = {Background Epilepsy carries an increased risk of premature death. For
   some people with intractable focal epilepsy, surgery offers hope for a
   seizure-free life. The authors aimed to see whether epilepsy surgery
   influenced mortality in people with intractable epilepsy.
   Methods The authors audited survival status in two cohorts (those who
   had surgery and those who had presurgical assessment but did not have
   surgery).
   Results There were 40 known deaths in the non-surgical group (3365
   person years of follow-up) and 19 in the surgical group (3905
   person-years of follow-up). Non-operated patients were 2.4 times (95\%
   CI 1.4 to 4.2) as likely to die as those who had surgery. They were 4.5
   times (95\% CI 1.9 to 10.9) as likely to die a probable epilepsy-related
   death. In the surgical group, those with ongoing seizures 1 year after
   surgery were 4.0 (95\% CI 1.2 to 13.7) times as likely to die as those
   who were seizure-free or who had only simple partial seizures.
   Time-dependent Cox analysis showed that the yearly outcome group did not
   significantly affect mortality (HR 1.3, 95\% CI 0.9 to 1.8).
   Conclusion Successful epilepsy surgery was associated with a reduced
   risk of premature mortality, compared with those with refractory focal
   epilepsy who did not have surgical treatment. To some extent, the
   reduced mortality is likely to be conferred by inducing freedom from
   seizures. It is not certain whether better survival is attributable only
   to surgery, as treatment decisions were not randomised, and there may be
   inherent differences between the groups.},

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the impact of hip osteoarthritis (OA) and/or
   hip symptoms on excess mortality.
   Design: We analyzed data from 3,919 individuals in a community-based
   prospective cohort of African Americans and Caucasians age >= 45 years.
   Women >= 50 years of age and all men underwent supine anteroposterior
   pelvic radiography at baseline, with the participant's feet in 15
   degrees of internal rotation. Hip radiographic (rOA) was defined as a
   Kellgren-Lawrence grade of >= 2 in at least one hip. Participants
   completed questionnaires at baseline to determine presence of hip
   symptoms and covariate status. Participants with symptomatic hip rOA
   (SxOA) are a subset of individuals with hip rOA and symptoms in the same
   hip. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing values of
   covariates. Mortality was determined through 2015 and follow-up time was
   calculated from baseline assessment until death or censoring which took
   place when a participant was lost to follow-up or reached the end of
   study period. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate
   hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). We carried out
   additional analyses stratified by sex, race, age and obesity.
   Results: Mean follow-up time was 14.2 years during which 1762 deaths
   occurred. There were 29.9\% participants in our population with hip rOA
   at baseline. Compared to those with neither hip rOA nor hip symptoms, we
   observed an increased risk of all-cause mortality in participants with
   hip symptoms alone (HR = 1.28, 95\% CI = 1.13-1.46), but no association
   for hip rOA either with or without symptoms. In stratified analyses we
   observed increased associations for hip symptoms alone and hip sxOA in
   those <65 years (43\% and 39\% increase, respectively) and in Caucasians
   (34\% and 21\% increase, respectively).
   Conclusions: Individuals who had hip symptoms without hip rOA had an
   increased risk of mortality. These effects were particularly strong for
   those who were <65 years of age and Caucasians. Effective interventions
   to identify those with hip pain in order to lessen it could reduce
   premature mortality. (C) 2020 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Title = {Estimation of US Children's Educational Attainment and Years of Life
   Lost Associated With Primary School Closures During the Coronavirus

Abstract = {This decision analytical model estimates the potential years of life
   lost among US primary school-aged children associated with school
   closures during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
   Importance United States primary school closures during the 2020
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected millions of
   children, with little understanding of the potential health outcomes
   associated with educational disruption. Objective To estimate the
   potential years of life lost (YLL) associated with the COVID-19 pandemic
   conditioned on primary schools being closed or remaining open. Design,
   Setting, and Participants This decision analytical model estimated the
   association between school closures and reduced educational attainment
   and the association between reduced educational attainment and life
   expectancy using publicly available data sources, including data for
   2020 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US
   Social Security Administration, and the US Census Bureau. Direct
   COVID-19 mortality and potential increases in mortality that might have
   resulted if school opening led to increased transmission of COVID-19
   were also estimated. Main Outcomes and Measures Years of life lost.
   Results A total of 24.2 million children aged 5 to 11 years attended
   public schools that were closed during the 2020 pandemic, losing a
   median of 54 (interquartile range, 48-62.5) days of instruction. Missed
   instruction was associated with a mean loss of 0.31 (95\% credible
   interval {[}CI], 0.10-0.65) years of final educational attainment for
   boys and 0.21 (95\% CI, 0.06-0.46) years for girls. Summed across the
   population, an estimated 5.53 million (95\% CI, 1.88-10.80) YLL may be
   associated with school closures. The Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention reported a total of 88241 US deaths from COVID-19 through the
   end of May 2020, with an estimated 1.50 million (95\% CI, 1.23-1.85
   million) YLL as a result. Had schools remained open, 1.47 million (95\%
   credible interval, 0.45-2.59) additional YLL could have been expected as
   a result, based on results of studies associating school closure with
   decreased pandemic spread. Comparing the full distributions of estimated
   YLL under both ``schools open{''} and ``schools closed{''} conditions,
   the analysis observed a 98.1\% probability that school opening would
   have been associated with a lower total YLL than school closure.
   Conclusions and Relevance In this decision analytical model of years of
   life potentially lost under differing conditions of school closure, the
   analysis favored schools remaining open. Future decisions regarding
   school closures during the pandemic should consider the association
   between educational disruption and decreased expected lifespan and give
   greater weight to the potential outcomes of school closure on children's
   health.
   Question Based on the current understanding of the associations between
   school disruption and decreased educational attainment and between
   decreased educational attainment and lower life expectancy, is it
   possible to estimate the association between school closure during the
   coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and decreased life expectancy of
   publicly educated primary school-aged children in the United States?
   Findings This decision analytical model found that missed instruction
   during 2020 could be associated with an estimated 5.53 million years of
   life lost. This loss in life expectancy was likely to be greater than
   would have been observed if leaving primary schools open had led to an
   expansion of the first wave of the pandemic. Meaning These findings
   suggest that the decision to close US public primary schools in the
   early months of 2020 may be associated with a decrease in life
   expectancy for US children.},

Title = {Social inequality in premature mortality among Polish urban adults

Abstract = {Rates of premature mortality among adults are important measures of the
   economic and psychosocial well-being of human populations. In many
   countries, such rates are, as a rule, inversely related to the level of
   attained education. We examined changes in educational group-specific
   mortality rates among urban adults in Poland during the country's rapid
   transition in the 1990s from a socialist command economy to a free
   market system. Two census-based analyses of individual death records of
   urban dwellers aged 35-64 years were compared. We utilized all records
   of death, which occurred during the 2-year periods 1988-89 and 2001-02.
   Population denominators were taken from the censuses of 1988 and 2002.
   The age-specific mortality rates were used to evaluate absolute
   differences in mortality. To assess relative differences between
   educational levels, mortality rate ratios (MRRs) with 95\% CI
   (confidence interval) were calculated using Poisson regression. A
   regular educational gradient in mortality persisted in each 10-year age
   group throughout the period covered by our data. Moreover, age-specific
   mortality rates declined steadily in all educational groups, and this
   decline was most marked in the two oldest age groups (45-54 and 55-64
   years). The trend was accompanied by widening of educational differences

Title = {The fall and rise of US inequities in premature mortality: 1960-2002},
Journal = {PLOS MEDICINE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-241},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background
   Debates exist as to whether, as overall population health improves, the
   absolute and relative magnitude of income- and race/ethnicity-related
   health disparities necessarily increase-or derease. We accordingly
   decided to test the hypothesis that health inequities widen-or shrink-in
   a context of declining mortality rates, by examining annual US mortality
   data over a 42 year period.
   Methods and Findings
   Using US county mortality data from 1960-2002 and county median family
   income data from the 1960-2000 decennial censuses, we analyzed the rates
   of premature mortality ( deaths among persons under age 65) and infant
   death ( deaths among persons under age 1) by quintiles of county median
   family income weighted by county population size. Between 1960 and 2002,
   as US premature mortality and infant death rates declined in all county
   income quintiles, socioeconomic and racial/ethnic inequities in
   premature mortality and infant death ( both relative and absolute)
   shrank between 1966 and 1980, especially for US populations of color;
   thereafter, the relative health inequities widened and the absolute
   differences barely changed in magnitude. Had all persons experienced the
   same yearly age-specific premature mortality rates as the white
   population living in the highest income quintile, between 1960 and 2002,
   14\% of the white premature deaths and 30\% of the premature deaths
   among populations of color would not have occurred.
   Conclusions
   The observed trends refute arguments that health inequities inevitably
   widen-or shrink - as population health improves. Instead, the magnitude
   of health inequalities can fall or rise; it is our job to understand
   why.},

Title = {Premature mortality of gastrointestinal cancer in Iran: trends and

Abstract = {Background The present study was conducted to determine the trend and
   projection of premature mortality from gastrointestinal cancers (GI
   cancers) at national and subnational levels in Iran. Methods Employing
   the data obtained from Iranian Death Registry System (DRS) and
   population data from census, the mortality rates of GI cancers was
   calculated among 30-70 age groups. The trends of esophageal, colon and
   rectum, gallbladder, pancreases, stomach, and liver cancer premature
   mortalities were estimated and projected at the national and subnational
   levels from 2001 to 2030. Then, Spatio-temporal model was used to
   project spatial and temporal correlations. Results The overall mortality
   rate of GI cancers was higher in males than in females, indicating 6.1,
   3.9 and 3.9\% per 100,000 individuals among males in 2001, 2015 and 2030
   respectively and 3.8, 3.1 and 3.7 per 100,000 individuals among females
   in the same time-frame. The overall mortality rate of GI cancers in
   males was decreasing until 2015 and will remain stationary into 2030;
   however, the rate will be increasing among females in both time-frames.
   Also, there was a considerable variation in the mortality trends of
   different cancers. Pancreatic, gallbladder, and liver cancers were shown
   to have an increasing trend while a drop was observed in the mortality
   rates of stomach, colon and rectum, and esophageal cancers. Conclusion
   Variation of GI cancers patterns and trends around the country indicated
   that a more comprehensive control plan is needed to include the
   predicted variations.},

Title = {Psychological distress and premature mortality in the general

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether higher rates of mortality are observed in
   people reporting psychological distress, to establish the nature of any
   excess, and to examine the possible existence of a dose response
   relationship.
   METHODS: We conducted a prospective follow-up study of mortality over an
   eight-year period in the North West of England. A total of 4,501 adults
   were recruited from two general practices during a population-based
   survey conducted at the start of 1992. At baseline psychological
   distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (12-item
   version, GHQ-12). The relationship between levels of distress and
   subsequent mortality was examined using Cox proportional hazard models.
   RESULTS: Risk of all-cause mortality was greatest in subjects reporting
   the highest levels of distress (hazard ratio (HR) 1.71, 95\% CI
   1.32-2.23) but was also raised in subjects reporting intermediate
   distress (HR 1.38 95\% CI 1.06-1.79) when compared to those reporting no
   distress. Increased risk of mortality in subjects reporting distress
   appeared to be due largely to an excess of deaths from ischaemic heart
   disease (high distress, HR 1.90, 95\% CI 1.08-3.35; intermediate
   distress, HR 1.58, 95\% CI 0.90-2.76) and respiratory diseases (high
   distress, HR 5.39, 95\% CI 2.70-10.78; intermediate distress, HR 2.33,
   95\% CI 1.12-4.22).
   CONCLUSIONS: The association between mortality and psychological
   distress observed in this study seems to arise largely because of
   premature deaths from ischaemic heart disease and respiratory diseases.
   The existence of a dose-response effect between distress and mortality
   provides further evidence to support the existence of a casual
   relationship. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Premature mortality in people with epilepsy in rural China: a

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Background in China, few studies have described annual mortality
   associated with epilepsy in a general population and these have provided
   a range of 3.0-7.9 deaths per 100 000 people. We calculated the case
   fatality rate (CFR), proportional mortality rate (PMR), and standardised
   mortality ratio (SMR) to assess mortality in people with epilepsy in
   rural China.
   Methods The target population was people with epilepsy who participated
   in an assessment of epilepsy management at primary health level in rural
   China. Neurologists confirmed the diagnosis using strict criteria in all
   participants who were then treated with phenobarbital. Demographic data
   and putative cause of death were recorded for each person whose death
   was reported. PMRs for each cause of death and SMRs were estimated on
   the basis of the 2004 Chinese population.
   Findings Case fatality rate was 1.4\% (35 deaths) among 2455 people with
   epilepsy. The age-adjusted PMRs for injury, stroke, neoplasm, myocardial
   infarction, and pneumonia were 30\%, 30\%, 15\%, 6\%, and 5\%,
   respectively. The SMR was 3.9 (95\% CI 3.8-3.9). Patients aged 15-29
   years had higher mortality ratios than did those in other age-groups,
   with SMRs exceeding 23.
   Interpretation Risk for premature death is three to four times higher in
   people with epilepsy than in the general Chinese population.
   Furthermore, the risk in young people with epilepsy in China is much
   higher than previously reported. Injury, stroke, myocardial infarction,
   and pneumonia are among the leading putative causes of death in patients
   with epilepsy in rural China.},

   Children born in 1987-2005, diagnosed with ASD by 2007 (n = 4695) were
   matched with four non-ASD subjects (n = 18,450) and followed until 2015
   for mortality and intentional self-harm. The risk among ASD subjects was
   elevated only for natural cause of death. The risk for intentional
   self-harm was increased in the unadjusted analyses, but decreased to
   non-significant after adjusting for comorbid psychiatric disorders. ASD
   subjects are at increased risk for premature mortality due to natural
   causes of death. While ASD subjects die of suicide and present with more
   self-harm, the association is explained by comorbid psychiatric
   disorders.},

Abstract = {Premature mortality is often a neglected component of overall deaths,
   and the most difficult to identify. However, it is important to estimate
   its prevalence. Following Pearson's theory about mortality components, a
   definition of premature deaths and a parametric model to study its
   transformations are introduced. The model is a mixture of three
   distributions: a Half Normal for the first part of the death curve and
   two Skew Normals to fit the remaining pieces. One advantage of the model
   is the possibility of obtaining an explicit equation to compute life
   expectancy at birth and to break it down into mortality components. We
   estimated the mixture model for Sweden, France, East Germany and Czech
   Republic. In addition, to the well-known reduction in infant deaths, and
   compression and shifting trend of adult mortality, we were able to study
   the trend of the central part of the distribution of deaths in detail.
   In general, a right shift of the modal age at death for young adults is
   observed; in some cases, it is also accompanied by an increase in the
   number of deaths at these ages: in particular for France, in the last
   twenty years, premature mortality increases.},

Abstract = {Background: While socioeconomic inequalities in mortality have widened
   in many countries, evidence of social differentials is scarce in
   Southern Europe. We studied temporal changes in premature mortality
   across socioeconomic groups in Rome between 1990 and 2001.
   Methods: We analysed all 126,511 death certificates of residents of Rome
   aged 0 - 74 years registered between 1990 - 2001. A 4-level census block
   index based on the 1991 census was used as an indicator of socioeconomic
   position (SEP). Using routine mortality data, standardised mortality
   rates ( per 100,000 inhabitants) were calculated by SEP and gender for
   four time periods. Rate ratios were used to compare mortality by gender
   and age.
   Results: Overall premature mortality decreased in both genders and in
   all socioeconomic groups; the change was greater in the highest
   socio-economic group. In both men and women, inequalities in mortality
   strengthened during the 1990s and appeared to stabilise at the end of
   the 20th century. However, for 60 - 74 year old women the gap continued
   to widen.
   Conclusion: Socioeconomic inequalities in health in Rome are still
   present at the beginning of the 21st century. Strategies to monitor the
   impact of SEP on mortality over time in different populations should be
   implemented to direct health policies.},

Title = {Premature mortality due to social and material deprivation in Nova
   Scotia, Canada},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Introduction: Inequalities in health attributable to inequalities in
   society have long been recognized. Typically, those most privileged
   experience better health, regardless of universal access to health care.
   Associations between social and material deprivation and mortality from
   all causes of death-a measure of population health, have been described
   for some regions of Canada. This study further examines the link between
   deprivation and health, focusing on major causes of mortality for both
   rural and urban populations. In addition, it quantifies the burden of
   premature mortality attributable to social and material deprivation in a
   Canadian setting where health care is accessible to all.
   Methods: The study included 35,266 premature deaths (1995-2005), grouped
   into five causes and aggregated over census dissemination areas. Two
   indices of deprivation (social and material) were derived from six
   socioeconomic census variables. Premature mortality was modeled as a
   function of these deprivation indices using Poisson regression.
   Results: Premature mortality increased significantly with increasing
   levels of social and material deprivation. The impact of material
   deprivation on premature mortality was similar in urban and rural
   populations, whereas the impact of social deprivation was generally
   greater in rural populations. There were a doubling in premature
   mortality for those experiencing a combination of the most extreme
   levels of material and social deprivation.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic deprivation is an important determinant of
   health equity and affects every segment of the population. Deprivation
   accounted for 40\% of premature deaths. The 4.3\% of the study
   population living in extreme levels of socioeconomic deprivation
   experienced a twofold increased risk of dying prematurely. Nationally,
   this inequitable risk could translate into a significant public health
   burden.},

Abstract = {Background: The survival rate of patients with primary adrenal
   insufficiency (Addison's disease) undergoing currently accepted
   replacement therapy is not known, although well-informed patients are
   considered to have a normal survival rate. In this study, we evaluated
   the mortality of patients with Addison's disease in Sweden.
   Methods: A population-based, retrospective, observational study was
   performed, using the National Swedish Hospital and Cause of Death
   Registers, covering the period from 1987-2001. After a diagnosis of
   Addison's disease, each patient was followed until the end of follow-up
   or death. Mortality was compared with that of the Swedish background
   population.
   Findings: We identified 1675 patients (995 women and 680 men) diagnosed
   with primary adrenal insufficiency. The average follow-up from initial
   diagnosis was 6.5 yr. Five hundred seven patients died during the study
   period compared with an expected 199. The risk ratio for all-cause
   mortality was 2.19 (confidence interval 1.91-2.51) for men and 2.86
   (confidence interval 2.54-3.20) for women. The excess mortality in both
   men and women was attributed to cardiovascular, malignant, and
   infectious diseases. Concomitant diabetes mellitus was observed in 12\%
   of the patients, but only contributed to the increased mortality to a
   minor extent.
   Interpretation: Compared with the background population, we observed
   that the risk ratio for death was more than 2-fold higher in patients
   with Addison's disease. Cardiovascular, malignant, and infectious
   diseases were responsible for the higher mortality rate.},

Title = {Model calculated global, regional and megacity premature mortality due

Abstract = {Air pollution by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) has
   increased strongly with industrialization and urbanization. We estimate
   the premature mortality rates and the years of human life lost (YLL)
   caused by anthropogenic PM2.5 and O-3 in 2005 for epidemiological
   regions defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). This is based
   upon high-resolution global model calculations that resolve urban and
   industrial regions in greater detail compared to previous work. Results
   indicate that 69\% of the global population is exposed to an annual mean
   anthropogenic PM2.5 concentration of >10 mu g m(-3) (WHO guideline) and
   33\% to >25 mu g m(-3) (EU directive). We applied an epidemiological
   health impact function and find that especially in large countries with
   extensive suburban and rural populations, air pollution-induced
   mortality rates have been underestimated given that previous studies
   largely focused on the urban environment. We calculate a global
   respiratory mortality of about 773 thousand/year (YLL approximate to 5.2
   million/year), 186 thousand/year by lung cancer (YLL approximate to 1.7
   million/year) and 2.0 million/year by cardiovascular disease (YLL
   approximate to 14.3 million/year). The global mean per capita mortality
   caused by air pollution is about 0.1\% yr(-1). The highest premature
   mortality rates are found in the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific
   regions (about 25\% and 46\% of the global rate, respectively) where
   more than a dozen of the most highly polluted megacities are located.},

Title = {Vitamin D and subsequent all-age and premature mortality: a systematic
   review},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {Background: All-cause mortality in the population < 65 years is 30\%
   higher in Glasgow than in equally deprived Liverpool and Manchester. We
   investigated a hypothesis that low vitamin D in this population may be
   associated with premature mortality via a systematic review and
   meta-analysis.
   Methods: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and grey
   literature sources were searched until February 2012 for relevant
   studies. Summary statistics were combined in an age-stratified
   meta-analysis.
   Results: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis, representing
   24,297 participants, 5,324 of whom died during follow-up. The pooled
   hazard ratio for low compared to high vitamin D demonstrated a
   significant inverse association (HR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.12-1.27) between
   vitamin D levels and all-cause mortality after adjustment for available
   confounders. In an age-stratified meta-analysis, the hazard ratio for
   older participants was 1.25 (95\% CI 1.14-1.36) and for younger
   participants 1.12 (95\% CI 1.01-1.24).
   Conclusions: Low vitamin D status is inversely associated with all-cause
   mortality but the risk is higher amongst older individuals and the
   relationship is prone to residual confounding. Further studies
   investigating the association between vitamin D deficiency and all-cause
   mortality in younger adults with adjustment for all important
   confounders (or using randomised trials of supplementation) are required
   to clarify this relationship.},

Abstract = {Background: Opioid substitution treatment (OST) has been implemented in
   Taiwan since 2006. We estimated the life expectancy (LE) and expected
   years of life lost (EYLL) in a cohort of heroin users stratified by OST
   for comparison.
   Methods: A total of 1283 heroin users recruited from 2006 to 2008 were
   linked to the National Mortality Registry until the end of 2011. Among
   them, 983 received OST, while 300 did not. Kaplan-Meier estimation for
   survival was performed, and it was extrapolated to 50 years to obtain
   the LE using a semi-parametric method. We further estimated the EYLL for
   both cohorts by subtracting their life expectancies from the age- and
   sex-matched referents of the general population. Cause-specific
   standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and compared with
   the national cohort to validate the representativeness of this sample.
   Results: After extrapolation to 50 years of survival, the estimated
   average LE and EYLL were 27.4 and 10.6 for OST subjects, respectively,
   while those of the non-OST were 20.2 and 18.4 years. The all-cause
   mortality rates (per 1000 person-years) in the observational period for
   the OST and non-OST group were 15.5 and 23.9, respectively, representing
   a 7.5- and 10.2-fold SMR compared to the general population, indicating
   a high representativeness for our sample. But SMR of suicide mortality
   elevated 16.2 and 3.1 folds in OST and non-OST group, respectively.
   Conclusions: OST saves 7.8 EYLL more than non-OST after accounting for
   lead time bias. Effective suicide prevention programs could enhance its
   life-saving effect, especially among those co-morbid with depressive
   disorders. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. This

Title = {Low ambient temperature shortened life expectancy in Hong Kong: A
   time-series analysis of 1.4 million years of life lost from
   cardiorespiratory diseases},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Ambient temperature is an important contributor to mortality burden
   worldwide, most of which is from cold exposure. However, little is known
   about the cold impact on life expectancy loss. This paper aimed to
   estimate cold-related life expectancy loss from cause-, age-, and
   gender-specific cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Daily deaths
   from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and weather records were
   acquired for Hong Kong, China during 2000-2016. Years of life lost (YLL)
   that considers life expectancy at the time of death was calculated by
   matching each death by age and sex to annual life tables. Using a
   generalized additive model that fits temperature-YLL association, we
   estimated loss of years in life expectancy from cold. Cold was estimated
   to cause life expectancy loss of 0.9 years in total cardiovascular
   disease, with more years of loss in males than in females and in people
   aged 65 years and older than in people aged up to 64 years. Cold-related
   life expectancy loss in total respiratory diseases was 1.2 years, with
   more years of loss in females than in males and comparable years of loss
   in people aged up to 64 years and in people aged 65 years and older.
   Among cause-specific diseases, we observed the greatest life expectancy
   loss in pneumonia (1.5 years), followed by ischaemic heart disease (1.2
   years), COPD (1.1 years), and stroke (0.3 years). Between two periods of
   2000-2007 and 2008-2016, cold-related life expectancy loss due to
   cardiovascular disease did not decrease and cold-related life expectancy
   loss due to respiratory disease even increased by five times. Our
   findings suggest an urgent need to develop prevention measures against
   adverse cold effects on cardiorespiratory disease in Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {Limited studies have explored the impacts of exposure to sustained high
   levels of air pollution (air pollution wave) on mortality. Given that
   the frequency, intensity and duration of air pollution wave has been
   increasing in highly polluted regions recently, understanding the
   impacts of air pollution wave is crucial. In this study, air pollution
   wave was defined as 2 or more consecutive days with air pollution index
   (API) > 100. The impacts of air pollution wave on years of life lost
   (YLL) due to non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory deaths were
   evaluated by considering both consecutive days with high levels of air
   pollution and daily air pollution levels in Tianjin, China, from 2006 to
   2011. The results showed the durational effect of consecutive days with
   high levels of air pollution was substantial in addition to the effect
   of daily air pollution. For instance, the durational effect was related
   to an increase in YLL of 116.6 (95\% CI: 4.8, 228.5) years from
   non-accidental deaths when the air pollution wave was sustained for 4
   days, while the corresponding daily air pollution's effect was 121.2
   (95\% CI: 55.2, 187.1) years. A better interpretation of the health
   risks of air pollution wave is crucial for air pollution control policy
   making and public health interventions.},

Title = {Estimation of Life Expectancy and the Expected Years of Life Lost in
   Patients with Major Cancers: Extrapolation of Survival Curves under
   High-Censored Rates},

Abstract = {Objectives: There exists a lack of extrapolation methods for long-term
   survival analysis when censored rates are high (25-50\%). This study
   aimed at estimating life expectancy (LE) after the diagnosis of cancer
   and the expected years of life lost (EYLL) using a newly developed
   semiparametric method.
   Methods: Patients (n = 425,294) diagnosed with 17 different types of
   major cancer were enrolled. All of the patients were registered with the
   Taiwan Cancer Registry between 1990 and 2001; their survivals were
   followed through the end of 2004. The survival function for an age- and
   sex-matched reference population was generated using the Monte Carlo
   method from the life table of the general population. Lifetime survival
   of the cancer patients (up to 50 years) were obtained using linear
   extrapolation of a logit-transformed curve of the survival ratio between
   the cancer and reference populations. The estimates were compared with
   the results from the extrapolation of fitted Weibull models.
   Results: The 15-year survival, LE, and EYLL for 17 different types of
   cancer were determined, of which the LE of breast, cervical, ovarian,
   and skin cancers exceeded 15 years; nasopharyneal, leukemia, bladder,
   kidney, and colorectal cancers exceeded 10 years. Validity tests
   indicated that the relative biases of the extrapolated estimates were
   usually < 5\% under high censoring rates.
   Conclusions: The newly developed method is feasible and relatively
   accurate to project LE and EYLL, which could also be merged with data
   pertaining to quality of life, for a more detailed outcome assessment in
   the future.},

Title = {Changes in patterns of mortality rates and years of life lost due to
   firearms in the United States, 1999 to 2016: A joinpoint analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Background
   Firearm-related death rates and years of potential life lost (YPLL) vary
   widely between population subgroups and states. However, changes or
   inflections in temporal trends within subgroups and states are not fully
   documented. We assessed temporal patterns and inflections in the rates
   of firearm deaths and \%YPLL due to firearms for overall and by sex,
   age, race/ethnicity, intent, and states in the United States between
   1999 and 2016.
   Methods
   We extracted age-adjusted firearm mortality and YPLL rates per 100,000,
   and \%YPLL from 1999 to 2016 by using the WONDER (Wide-ranging Online
   Data for Epidemiologic Research) database. We used Joinpoint Regression
   to assess temporal trends, the inflection points, and annual percentage
   change (APC) from 1999 to 2016.
   Results
   National firearm mortality rates were 10.3 and 11.8 per 100,000 in 1999
   and 2016, with two distinct segments; a plateau until 2014 followed by
   an increase of APC = 7.2\% (95\% CI 3.1, 11.4). YPLL rates were from
   304.7 and 338.2 in 1999 and 2016 with a steady APC increase in \%YPLL of
   0.65\% (95\% CI 0.43, 0.87) from 1999 to an inflection point in 2014,
   followed by a larger APC in \%YPLL of 5.1\% (95\% CI 0.1, 10.4). The
   upward trend in firearm mortality and YPLL rates starting in 2014 was
   observed in subgroups of male, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanic whites and
   for firearm assaults. The inflection points for firearm mortality and
   YPLL rates also varied across states.
   Conclusions
   Within the United States, firearm mortality rates and YPLL remained
   constant between 1999 and 2014 and has been increasing subsequently.
   There was, however, an increase in firearm mortality rates in several
   subgroups and individual states earlier than 2014.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Metastatic melanoma (MM) is a leading cause of years of life
   lost due to malignancy. This study aimed to identify the average years
   of life lost (AYLL) in MM patients. Methods: MM patients were identified
   from a prospectively maintained database, and a linear model predicting
   AYLL was developed. Results: Between 1970 and 1999, 4,774 patients
   diagnosed with MM died. The AYLL was 23.2 years. AYLL remained stable
   across three decades. Conclusions: AYLL for MM is greater than 20 years,
   and has not improved. This burden underscores the need for continued
   research and access to funding for this disease.},

Title = {Short-term effects of fine particulate matter on acute myocardial
   infraction mortality and years of life lost: A time series study in Hong

Abstract = {Previous studies have applied years of life lost (YLL) as a
   complementary indicator to assess the short-term effect of the air
   pollution on the health burden from all-cause mortality, but sparsely
   focused on individual diseases such as acute myocardial infraction
   (AMI). In this study, we aimed to conduct a time-series analysis to
   evaluate short-term effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on
   mortality and YLL from AMI in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2015, and explore
   the potential effect modifiers including sex and age by subgroup
   analysis. We applied generalized additive Poisson and Gaussian
   regression model for daily death count and YLL, respectively. We found
   that 10 mu g/m(3) increment in concentration of PM2.5 lasting for two
   days (lag(01)) was associated with a 2.35\% (95\% CI 0.38\% to 4.36\%)
   increase in daily mortality count and a 1.69 (95\% CI 0.01 to 3.37)
   years increase in YLL from AMI. The association between PM2.5 and AMI
   mortality count was stronger among women and older people than men and
   young people, respectively. We concluded that acute exposure to PM2.5
   may increase the risk of mortality and YLL from AMI in Hong Kong and
   this effect can be modified by age and gender. These findings add to the
   evidence base for public health policy formulation and resource
   allocation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to calculate average years of life lost
   due to breast and cervical cancer in Mexico in 2000 and 2010. Data on
   mortality in women aged between 20 and 84 years was obtained from the
   National Institute for Statistics and Geography. Age-specific mortality
   rates and average years of life lost, which is an estimate of the number
   of years that a person would have lived if he or she had not died
   prematurely, were estimated for both diseases. Data was disaggregated
   into five-year age groups and socioeconomic status based on the 2010
   marginalization index obtained from the National Population Council. A
   decrease in average years of life lost due to cervical cancer (37.4\%)
   and an increase in average years of life lost due breast cancer (8.9\%)
   was observed during the period studied. Average years of life lost due
   to cervical cancer was greater among women living in areas with a high
   marginalization index, while average years of life lost due to breast
   cancer was greater in women from areas with a low marginalization index.},

Abstract = {Ambient air pollution is one of the most significant environmental
   problems, and many individuals around the world die each year
   prematurely from diseases caused by this type of pollution. PM(2.5)can
   transpire deep to the lungs and induce some dangerous health effects in
   humans. In this study, the health effects of long-term PM(2.5)were
   estimated on expected life remaining (ELR) and years of life lost (YLL)
   indices in Ahvaz city during the years 2008-2017 using the AirQ+
   software developed by WHO. Values obtained from the PM(2.5)averaging,
   ELR, and YLL data were processed for the whole population in the age
   range of 0-64 and over 64. These values were entered into AirQ+
   software. The mean annual concentration of PM(2.5)was highly variable,
   with the highest concentration being 70.72 mu g/m(3)in 2010 and the
   lowest 41.97 mu g/m(3)in 2014. In all studied years, the concentration
   of PM(2.5)with the variations between 4.2 to 7.07 times was higher than
   the WHO standard (10 mu g/m(3)). Ahvaz city also did not experience any
   clean day during the 10-year period, and in 2010, there were 47 very
   unhealthy days and 27 dangerous days, i.e., the highest number of very
   unhealthy and dangerous days during the period. The results estimated
   that the highest and lowest YLL in the next 10 years for all ages groups
   would be 137,760.49 (2010) and 5035.52 (2014), respectively. Also, the
   ELR index was lower than the Iranian standard and EPA which was
   significantly correlated with the concentration of PM2.5.},

Title = {Standard mortality rates and years of life lost for serologically
   defined adult-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetes - A fifteen year
   follow-up},
Journal = {DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aims: The Diabetes Incidence in Kronoberg (DIK) study of adult-onset
   diabetes used serological classification. Standard Mortality Rates (SMR)
   and Years of Life Lost (YLL) 15 years after adult-onset (18-100 years)
   of diabetes were compared to the population of Kronoberg.
   Methods: Of 1609/1660 (97\%) patients, 112 (7\%) had type 1 (T1D) (GADA+
   and/or ICA+, and/or C-peptide < 0.25 nmol/l), and 1497 (93\%) had type 2
   diabetes (T2D) (antibody(-) and C-pepti de >= 0.25 nmol/l). The National
   Swedish Mortality Register provided time of death.
   Results: For T1D SMR did not differ from the Kronoberg population in any
   age group. In T2D SMR was 1.20 (1.12-1.29). After 15 years 26\% (29/112)
   T1D and 52\% (785/1497) T2D patients had died, p < 0.0001. In T2D SMR
   was 5.6 (30-39 years), 2 (40-59 years), 1.4 (60-69 years), and
   thereafter no difference. There were no significant sex differences in
   mortality, and no YLL to adult-onset T1D, but five YLL to T2D for onset
   at ages 20-60 years.
   Conclusions: For adult-onset T1D SMR did not differ from the general
   population, in contrast to previous findings in childhood-onset (< 30
   years of age) T1D. The difference in mortality between persons with
   diabetes and the general population was due to higher mortality in T2D.

Title = {National and Subnational Incidence, Mortality, and Years of Life Lost
   Due to Breast Cancer in Iran: Trends and Age-Period-Cohort Analysis
   Since 1990},

Abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, causing
   considerable burden and mortality. Demographic and lifestyle transitions
   in low and low-middle income countries have given rise to its increased
   incidence. The successful management of cancer relies on evidence-based
   policies taking into account national epidemiologic settings. We aimed
   to report the national and subnational trends of breast cancer
   incidence, mortality, years of life lost (YLL) and mortality to
   incidence ratio (MIR) since 1990. As part of the National and
   Subnational Burden of Diseases project, we estimated incidence,
   mortality and YLL of breast cancer by sex, age, province, and year using
   a two-stage spatio-temporal model, based on the primary dataset of
   national cancer and death registry. MIR was calculated as a quality of
   care indicator. Age-period-cohort analysis was used to distinguish the
   effects of these three collinear factors. A significant threefold
   increase in age-specific incidence at national and subnational levels
   along with a twofold extension of provincial disparity was observed.
   Although mortality has slightly decreased since 2000, a positive
   mortality annual percent change was detected in patients aged 25-34
   years, leading to raised YLLs. A significant declining pattern of MIR
   and lower provincial MIR disparity was observed. We observed a secular
   increase of breast cancer incidence. Further evaluation of risk factors
   and developing national screening policies is recommended. A descending
   pattern of mortality, YLL and MIR at national and subnational levels
   reflects improved quality of care, even though mortality among younger
   age groups should be specifically addressed.},

Title = {PREMATURE MORTALITY IN AUSTRALIA 1983-1992, THE FIRST DECADE OF THE AIDS
   EPIDEMIC},
Journal = {MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {161},

Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Objective: To determine the trends in premature mortality due to
   selected causes in Australia and in selected States for the whole
   population and for adults aged 25 to 44 years.
   Design: Analysis of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and
   the National AIDS Registry for the 10 years from 1983 to 1992. Premature
   mortality was measured in terms of years of potential Life lost before
   the age of 75 years (YPLL-75). Trends in premature mortality due to AIDS
   were compared with those for lung cancer, melanoma of the skin, breast
   cancer, diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular
   disease, traffic accidents and suicide.
   Results: There have been marked increases in premature mortality due to
   AIDS and suicide in young men and an increase in deaths due to breast
   cancer in young women over the past decade. The overall number of
   potential years of life lost has remained constant, partially because
   these increases have been counterbalanced by declines in deaths from
   traffic accidents, acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular
   disease. The increasing trend in premature mortality due to AIDS is
   strongest in New South Wales, followed by Victoria and Queensland, with
   smaller increases in the other States and Territories.
   Conclusions: Apparent advances in medical care have reduced premature
   deaths from acute myocardial infarction and stroke and public health
   measures are Likely to have reduced traffic accident deaths; but at the
   same time there have been serious increases in HIV, suicide and breast
   cancer among young adults.},

Title = {Impacts of 21st century climate change on global air pollution-related
   premature mortality},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {121},
Number = {2},
Pages = {239-253},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change modulates surface concentrations of fine particulate
   matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3), indirectly affecting premature mortality
   attributed to air pollution. We estimate the change in global premature
   mortality and years of life lost (YLL) associated with changes in
   surface O-3 and PM2.5 over the 21st century as a result of climate
   change. We use a global coupled chemistry-climate model to simulate
   current and future climate and the effect of changing climate on air
   quality. Epidemiological concentration-response relationships are
   applied to estimate resulting changes in premature mortality and YLL.
   The effect of climate change on air quality is isolated by holding
   emissions of air pollutants constant while allowing climate to evolve
   over the 21st century according to a moderate projection of greenhouse
   gas emissions (A1B scenario). Resulting changes in 21st century climate
   alone lead to an increase in simulated PM2.5 concentrations globally,
   and to higher (lower) O-3 concentrations over populated (remote)
   regions. Global annual premature mortality associated with chronic
   exposure to PM2.5 increases by approximately 100 thousand deaths (95 \%
   confidence interval, CI, of 66-130 thousand) with corresponding YLL
   increasing by nearly 900 thousand (95 \% CI, 576-1,128 thousand) years.
   The annual premature mortality due to respiratory disease associated
   with chronic O-3 exposure increases by +6,300 deaths (95 \% CI,
   1,600-10,400). This climate penalty indicates that stronger emission
   controls will be needed in the future to meet current air quality
   standards and to avoid higher health risks associated with climate
   change induced worsening of air quality over populated regions.},

Abstract = {Most recent research reveals that social inequalities in premature
   mortality are widening. Such findings mainly apply to countries as a
   whole. In this study, we model recent changes in the association between
   premature mortality and a deprivation index (a small area-based index)
   in four geographic settings in Quebec, namely the Montreal metropolitan
   area, other Quebec metropolitan areas, mid-size cities, and small towns
   and rural areas. Deaths from all-cause and specific causes of mortality
   among people under age 75 are considered for the periods 1989-1993 and
   1999-2003. Mortality rates are modeled using negative binomial
   regressions. Models are fitted for the overall population and for men
   and women, separately, in every geographic setting. Three measures of
   inequalities are used: mortality rates for different population groups,
   rate ratios and rate differences. Results show that social inequalities
   in premature mortality increase everywhere in Quebec except in the
   Montreal metropolitan area. Presently, the highest mortality rates among
   deprived groups are found in mid-size cities, small towns and rural
   areas; the highest rate ratios in the Montreal metropolitan area and
   other metropolitan areas of Quebec; and the highest rate differences in
   the Montreal metropolitan area, other metropolitan areas of Quebec and
   mid-size cities. These results are discussed with reference to possible
   explanatory factors, namely relative deprivation, smoking, immigration
   and internal migration. Indications on future research and policy
   implications are provided. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by

Abstract = {Exposure to ambient ozone (O-3) is a risk factor for public health and
   causes damage to vegetation, including agricultural crops. In this
   study, we performed a comprehensive estimate of the spatial distribution
   of premature deaths and main crop yield losses attributed to ambient
   O-3, across China in 2014, by applying the Global Burden of Diseases
   approach and AOT40 metric (i.e., above a threshold of O-3 concentration
   of 40 ppb). Our results show that China's total premature deaths in 2014
   due to COPD attributed to O-3 exposure were 89,391 (CI95:
   32,225-141,649) with spatial variation across provinces. O-3 induced
   production losses from all crops were 78.4 million metric tons, and the
   relative yield losses ranged from 8.5 to 14.0\% for winter wheat,
   3.9-15.0\% for rice, and 2.2-5.5\% for maize. The top four Chinese
   provinces (Sichuan, Shandong, Henan and Hunan) for premature deaths
   attributed to O-3 pollution also suffered severe losses in yields of
   winter wheat and rice. Our results provide quantitative evidence of O-3
   induced impacts on both the public health and crop yields across Chinese
   provinces, which have important policy implications for the government
   to alleviate O-3 pollution in addition to PM2.5 pollution that is
   currently being addressed.},

Title = {Premature mortality in Slovenia in relation to selected biological,
   socioeconomic, and geographical determinants},

Abstract = {Aim To determine biological (sex and age), socioeconomic (marital
   status, education, and mother tongue) and geographical (region) factors
   connected with causes of death and lifespan (age at death,
   years-of-potential-life-lost, and mortality race) in Slovenia in the
   1990s.
   Methods In this poptilation-basedc ross-sectorial study, we analyzed all
   deaths in the 25-64 age group (N = 14 816) in Slovenia in 1992, 1995,
   and 1998. Causes of death, classified into groups according to the 10th
   revision of International Classification of Diseases, were linked to
   rile data oil the deceased from the 1991 Census. Stratified
   contingency-table analyses were performed. Years-of-potential-life-lost
   (YPLL) were calculated on the basis of population life-tables stratified
   by region and linearly modeled by the characteristics of the deceased.
   Poisson regression,vas applied to rest the differences in mortality
   rate.
   Results Across all socioeconomic strata, men died at younger age than
   women (index of excess mortality in men exceeded 200 for all studied
   years) and from different prevailing causes (injuries in men aged < 45
   years; neoplasms in women aged > 35 years). For men, higher education
   was associated with fewer deaths from digestive and respiratory system
   diseases. The least educated women died relatively often from
   circulatory diseases, but rarely from neoplasms. Single people died from
   neoplasms less often. Marriage in comparison with divorce reduced the
   mortality rate by 1.9-fold in both men and women (P < 0.001). Mortality,
   race in both men and women decreased with increasing education level (P
   < 0.001). Mortality rate of ethnic Slovenians was half the mortality
   rate of ethnic minority members and immigrants (P < 0.001). Analysis of
   WILL revealed limited and nonlinear impact of education level on
   premature mortality. The share of neoplasms was the highest in the
   cluster of socioeconomically. prosperous regions, whereas the share of
   circulatory diseases was increased in poorer regions. Significant
   differences were found between individual regions in age at death and
   mortality rate, and the differences decreased over the studied period.
   Conclusion These data may aid in understanding the nature, prevalence
   and consequences of mortality as related to socioeconomic inequalities,
   and thus serve as a basis for setting health and social policy goals and
   planning health measures.},

Title = {The Global Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Premature Mortality and
   Health in 2016},
Journal = {NUTRIENTS},

Abstract = {This study aimed to estimate the impact of alcohol use on mortality and
   health among people 69 years of age and younger in 2016. A comparative
   risk assessment approach was utilized, with population-attributable
   fractions being estimated by combining alcohol use data from the Global
   Information System on Alcohol and Health with corresponding relative
   risk estimates from meta-analyses. The mortality and health data were
   obtained from the Global Health Observatory. Among people 69 years of
   age and younger in 2016, 2.0 million deaths and 117.2 million Disability
   Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost were attributable to alcohol
   consumption, representing 7.1\% and 5.5\% of all deaths and DALYs lost
   in that year, respectively. The leading causes of the burden of
   alcohol-attributable deaths were cirrhosis of the liver (457,000
   deaths), road injuries (338,000 deaths), and tuberculosis (190,000
   deaths). The numbers of premature deaths per 100,000 people were highest
   in Eastern Europe (155.8 deaths per 100,000), Central Europe (52.3
   deaths per 100,000 people), and Western sub-Saharan Africa (48.7 deaths
   per 100,000). A large portion of the burden of disease caused by alcohol
   among people 69 years of age and younger is preventable through the
   implementation of cost-effective alcohol policies such as increases in
   taxation.},

Abstract = {The 2016 election highlighted deep divisions in the USA, and exposed
   unhappiness and frustration among poor and uneducated whites. The
   starkest marker of this unhappiness is the rise in preventable deaths
   and suicides among the middle aged of this cohort. In contrast,
   minorities have much higher levels of optimism, and their life
   expectancies continue to rise. Low-income respondents display the
   largest differences, with poor blacks by far the most optimistic, and
   poor rural whites the least. African Americans and Hispanics also have
   higher life satisfaction and lower stress incidence than poor whites.
   The gaps across racial groups peak in middle age, at the nadir of the
   U-curve of age and life satisfaction. We explored the association
   between our subjective well-being data and the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC) mortality data. We find that the absence of
   hope among less than college-educated whites matches the trends in
   premature mortality among 35-64-year-olds. Reported pain, reliance on
   disability insurance, low labor force participation, and differential
   levels of resilience across races all have mediating effects in the
   desperation-mortality associations. We also explore the role of place,
   and map the states associated with higher/lower indicators of well-being
   for these different cohorts. The matches between indicators of
   well-being and of mortality suggest that the former could serve as
   warning indicators of ill-being in the future, rather than waiting for
   rising mortality to sound the alarms.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveTo review and complete meta-analysis of studies estimating
   standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) in bipolar affective disorder
   (BPAD) for all-cause and cause-specific mortalities.
   MethodCause-specific mortality was grouped into natural and unnatural
   causes. These subgroups were further divided into circulatory,
   respiratory, neoplastic and infectious causes, and suicide and other
   violent deaths. Summary SMRs were calculated using random-effects
   meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was examined via subgroup analysis and
   meta-regression.
   ResultsSystematic searching found 31 studies meeting inclusion criteria.
   Summary SMR for all-cause mortality=2.05 (95\% CI 1.89-2.23), but
   heterogeneity was high (I-2=96.2\%). This heterogeneity could not be
   accounted for by date of publication, cohort size, mid-decade of data
   collection, population type or geographical region. Unnatural death
   summary SMR=7.42 (95\% CI 6.43-8.55) and natural death=1.64 (95\% CI
   1.47-1.83). Specifically, suicide SMR=14.44 (95\% CI 12.43-16.78), other
   violent death SMR=3.68 (95\% CI 2.77-4.90), deaths from circulatory
   disease=1.73 (95\% CI 1.54-1.94), respiratory disease=2.92 (95\% CI
   2.00-4.23), infection=2.25 (95\% CI 1.70-3.00) and neoplasm=1.14 (95\%
   CI 1.10-1.21).
   ConclusionDespite considerable heterogeneity, all summary SMR estimates
   and a large majority of individual studies showed elevated mortality in
   BPAD compared to the general population. This was true for all causes of
   mortality studied.},

Title = {Geographic and Racial Variation in Premature Mortality in the US:
   Analyzing the Disparities},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {Life expectancy at birth, estimated from United States period life
   tables, has been shown to vary systematically and widely by region and
   race. We use the same tables to estimate the probability of survival
   from birth to age 70 (S-70), a measure of mortality more sensitive to
   disparities and more reliably calculated for small populations, to
   describe the variation and identify its sources in greater detail to
   assess the patterns of this variation. Examination of the unadjusted
   probability of S-70 for each US county with a sufficient population of
   whites and blacks reveals large geographic differences for each race-sex
   group. For example, white males born in the ten percent healthiest
   counties have a 77 percent probability of survival to age 70, but only a
   61 percent chance if born in the ten percent least healthy counties.
   Similar geographical disparities face white women and blacks of each
   sex. Moreover, within each county, large differences in S-70 prevail
   between blacks and whites, on average 17 percentage points for men and
   12 percentage points for women. In linear regressions for each race-sex
   group, nearly all of the geographic variation is accounted for by a
   common set of 22 socio-economic and environmental variables, selected
   for previously suspected impact on mortality; R-2 ranges from 0.86 for
   white males to 0.72 for black females. Analysis of black-white survival
   chances within each county reveals that the same variables account for
   most of the race gap in S-70 as well. When actual white male values for
   each explanatory variable are substituted for black in the black male
   prediction equation to assess the role explanatory variables play in the
   black-white survival difference, residual black-white differences at the
   county level shrink markedly to a mean of -2.4\% (+/-2.4); for women the
   mean difference is -3.7\% (+/-2.3).},

Title = {Trend and Projection of Premature Mortality in Iran through 2030: A
   Modeling Study},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Projection of mortality rates is essential for policy making
   and planning of health services. Premature mortality, as an important
   index, commonly refers to deaths occurring before 70 years of age. This
   study was conducted to estimate the trend of premature deaths from
   2006-2015 and to project premature deaths for the 2016-2030 period.
   Methods: We used national mortality data collected by the Ministry of
   Health and Medical Education's Deputy of Health, and population data
   from the Statistical Center of Iran. Mortality and population data were
   categorized based on sex and 5-year age groups. The Bayesian
   hierarchical model was used to project future premature mortality rates
   through 2030.
   Results: Age-standardized all-cause premature mortality declines from
   414.3 per 100 000 persons in 2010 to 300.3 per 100 000 persons in 2030
   (27.5\%) for men, and from 230.6 per 100 000 persons in 2010 to 197.2
   per 100 000 persons in 2030 (14.5\%) for women. In all age groups, the
   percent reduction of premature mortality was greater for men than women.
   Conclusion: Overall, it is projected that premature mortality will
   witness a declining trend in both sexes in Iran. Accordingly, we would
   expect to achieve less than a third reduction in premature mortality by
   2030, which is one of the Sustainable Development Goals.},

   premature mortality},
Journal = {HEALTH \& PLACE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {90-96},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The health of rural and urban populations differs, with rural areas
   appearing healthier. However, it is unknown whether the benefit of
   living in rural areas is felt by individuals in all levels of
   deprivation, or whether some suffer a disadvantage of rural residence.
   For England and Wales 2001-2003 premature mortality rates were
   calculated, subdivided by individual deprivation and gender, for areas
   with differing rurality characteristics. Premature mortality data (age
   50-retirement) and a measure of the individual's deprivation (National
   Statistics Socio-economic Classification 1-7) was obtained from death
   certificates. Overall premature mortality was examined as well as
   premature mortality subdivided by major cause. Male premature mortality
   rates (age 50-64) fell with increasing rurality for individuals in all
   socioeconomic status classifications. The most deprived individuals
   benefitted most from residence in increasingly rural areas. Similar
   trends were observed when premature mortality was subdivided by the
   major causes of death. Female premature mortality rates (age 50-59)
   demonstrated similar trends but the differences between urban and rural
   areas were less marked. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objectives. This study examined trends in mortality by social class for
   Black and White men aged 35 through 54 years in North Carolina, for 1984
   through 1993, using an inexpensive, newly developed state-based
   surveillance method.
   Methods. Data from death certificates and census fries permitted
   examination of four social classes, defined on the basis of occupation.
   Results. Premature mortality was inversely associated with social class
   for both Blacks and Whites. Blacks were at least twice as likely to die
   as Whites within each social class.
   Conclusions. Adoption of state specific surveillance of social class and
   premature mortality would provide data crucial for developing and
   evaluating Public health programs to reduce social inequalities in
   health.},

Title = {Socioeconomic inequalities in premature mortality in France: Have they

Abstract = {An increase in social inequalities in premature mortality has been
   observed in the last decades in various European countries. In France,
   large inequalities have been reported for several years, but the changes
   over time have been only partially examined.
   The study was based on the analysis of a large longitudinal data set.
   Four periods of 7 years following a census were compared. Deaths in the
   period (21,003 deaths for men, 9418 for women) were recorded and studied
   according to socioeconomic status (SES) at the census. Relative Index of
   Inequality (RII) was calculated in order to quantify the magnitude of
   inequalities among those employed, and also in the entire population,
   with specific categories for those inactive. The results showed that the
   magnitude of inequalities remained mainly stable over time for men and
   women working at the time of the census. However, for the entire
   population, a strong increase in the magnitude of social inequalities
   was observed. For men the RIIs increased from 3.53 in the first period
   to 6.54 in the most recent period. For women, the corresponding figures
   were 1.94 and 3.88. The increase was observed also for specific causes
   of deaths: cancer and cardiovascular diseases for both sexes, and
   external causes for men. In spite of a global decrease in the mortality
   over the period, the absolute differences between the top and the bottom
   of the socioeconomic scale did not change.
   The results highlight the importance of temporal changes in mortality
   associated with an increase of unemployment, changes in the labour
   market, and the consequences of selective exclusion from work. The
   classification of those not working is an important point to consider in
   the study of social inequalities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Modeled global effects of airborne desert dust on air quality and
   premature mortality},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {957-968},
Abstract = {Fine particulate matter is one of the most important factors
   contributing to air pollution. Epidemiological studies have related
   increased levels of atmospheric particulate matter to premature human
   mortality caused by cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer. However, a
   limited number of investigations have focused on the contribution of
   airborne desert dust particles. Here we assess the effects of dust
   particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (DU2.5) on
   human mortality for the year 2005. We used the EMAC
   atmospheric-chemistry general circulation model at high resolution to
   simulate global atmospheric dust concentrations. We applied a health
   impact function to estimate premature mortality for the global
   population of 30 yr and older, using parameters from epidemiological
   studies. We estimate a global cardiopulmonary mortality of about 402 000
   in 2005. The associated years of life lost are about 3.47 million per
   year. We estimate the global fraction of the cardiopulmonary deaths
   caused by atmospheric desert dust to be about 1.8 \%, though in the 20
   countries most affected by dust this is much higher, about 15-50 \%.
   These countries are primarily found in the so-called ``dust belt{''}
   from North Africa across the Middle East and South Asia to East Asia},

Abstract = {Objective: To verify the variation of the premature mortality rate
   caused the group of the main chronic noncommunicable diseases. Method:
   This is a time-series ecological study, which used secondary data of the
   Mortality Information System, from 2006 to 2014, from the 26 federal
   units and from the Federal District. Deaths caused by circulatory system
   diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases were
   included. The trend of adjusted mortality rate was analyzed by segmented
   linear regression. Results: Premature mortality tended to be reduced in
   most states, except for Maranhao and Rio Grande do Norte, which
   presented a stable premature mortality rate. Bahia, Pernambuco, Sergipe,
   Roraima and all the states from the South, Southeast and Central-West
   Regions reached the goal of reducing 2\% per year in premature mortality
   caused by main diseases. Conclusion: Most of the states showed a reduced
   mortality rate and are reaching the proposed target.},

Title = {Causes of premature mortality in schizophrenia: a review of literature

Abstract = {Purpose of review The current review examines the recent literature on
   the causes of premature mortality in schizophrenia. Recent findings
   People with schizophrenia have higher premature mortality rates compared
   with the general population. Suicides and accidents account for a
   nontrivial part of the excess mortality, but the largest part is
   attributable to natural causes of death. Five major causes have been
   identified: first, adverse effects of medication; second, suboptimal
   lifestyle; third, somatic comorbidity; fourth, suboptimal treatment of
   somatic disorders; and fifth, accelerated ageing/genetic explanations.
   The positive aspect is that people with schizophrenia have increasing
   life expectancy, at least in high-income countries, and this development
   seems to largely follow the increase in the general population.
   Especially mortality rates from unnatural causes appear to have a
   positive impact. Nevertheless, despite more than 100 years of research
   and progress, the excess mortality in persons with schizophrenia remains
   unacceptably high, with no prospects of reaching the level in the
   general population. The excess mortality in schizophrenia has received
   much focus. Future studies should explore the reasons for the high rates
   of natural causes of death, while aiming to disentangle the complex
   interplay between medication, lifestyle, comorbidity, treatment of
   somatic disorders, and genetic effects.},

Title = {Consumption-based PM2.5-related premature mortality in the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, which has a resource-dependent
   economy dominated by clusters of heavy industries, has long borne the
   highest PM2.5 pollution levels in China, prompting serious concerns
   about the region's disease burden. Pollution-intensive industries in the
   BTH region not only meet local consumer demands but also those of other
   places via the supply chain. In the present study, we combined a
   multi-region input-output model with adjoint source sensitivity modeling
   technique at a high resolution (025 degrees x 0.3125 degrees) to
   apportion PM2.5-related mortality risks in the BTH to consuming areas
   and sectors. The model predicted that exposure to ambient PM(2)(.5
   )caused 0.12 million premature deaths (95\% confidence interval:
   0.08-0.15) in the BTH region in 2013. The adjoint source sensitivity
   results showed that only 46\% of the total premature deaths were
   attributable to local consumption. The top contributors of local
   consumption were rural households and the agricultural sector in Hebei,
   and service sector in Beijing. Consumption of other domestic regions and
   international export accounted for 25\% of the total premature deaths in
   the BTH, mainly to support consumption of manufacturing and construction
   products of these outer regions. Atmospheric transport of pollutants,
   mainly from the surrounding areas, accounted for the remaining 29\% of
   total deaths in BTH. Our findings underline the consumption-based driven
   force of BTH's pollution and associated health impacts, which may
   facilitate the joint control actions among the BTH region and its
   surrounding areas from a comprehensive perspective. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Title = {Premature Mortality From General Medical Illnesses Among Persons With
   Bipolar Disorder: A Review},

Abstract = {Objective: Despite recent evidence that patients with bipolar disorder
   are at increased risk of premature mortality resulting from general
   medical disorders, there has been no systematic review of published
   studies. The authors reviewed the literature to determine whether there
   is evidence of increased risk of mortality from general medical causes
   among patients with bipolar spectrum disorders. Methods: MEDLINE was
   searched from 1959 to 2007 with a focus on bipolar disorder and medical
   mortality. Published studies in English with more than 100 patients were
   included. Results: Seventeen studies were identified involving 331,000
   patients with bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, affective disorder
   severe enough to require inpatient psychiatric care or treatment with
   lithium, or wschizoaffective disorder (that is, bipolar spectrum
   disorders) meeting the inclusion criteria. Compared with age- and
   sex-matched control samples without mental illness in the general
   population, mortality ratios for death from natural causes and from
   specific general medical conditions, such as cardiovascular,
   respiratory, cerebrovascular, and endocrine disorders, were
   significantly higher among patients with bipolar spectrum disorders in
   most studies. This finding was more consistent in larger studies with
   more than 2,500 patients with bipolar spectrum disorders. Cumulatively,
   cardiovascular disorder appeared to be the most consistent cause of
   excess mortality in larger studies. Conclusions: The available evidence
   suggests that bipolar spectrum disorders are associated with increased
   premature mortality secondary to general medical illnesses. Unhealthy
   lifestyle, biological factors, adverse pharmacologic effects, and
   disparities in health care are possible underlying causes for this
   excess mortality. (Psychiatric Services 60: 147-156, 2009)},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to assess status, and understand burden, of
   premature and leading causes of deaths from noncommunicable diseases
   (NCDs) in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). From 2003 to 2012,
   ICD-10 coded mortality data from the national Health Information System
   were analyzed. Proportional mortality was calculated and a ranking list
   of the leading causes of premature death was produced. Of the 2349
   premature deaths reported, 1970 (83.9\%) were due to NCDs, and 1680
   (71.5\%) were from 4 main NCD groupscardiovascular diseases, cancer,
   diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. Diabetes (19.5\%), ischemic
   heart diseases (13.2\%), and cerebrovascular diseases (7.1\%) were the
   leading causes of premature deaths. The findings indicate that the
   burden of premature NCD deaths in FSM is higher than global levels, and
   existing efforts need to be strengthened to alter their course.},

Abstract = {Background This study aims to analyze the trends of premature mortality
   caused from four major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), namely
   cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and
   diabetes in Nanjing between 2007 and 2018 and project the ability to
   achieve the ``Healthy China 2030{''} reduction target. Methods Mortality
   data of four major NCDs for the period 2007-2018 were extracted from the
   Death Information Registration and Management System of Chinese Center
   for Disease Control and Prevention. Population data for Nanjing were
   provided by the Nanjing Bureau of Public Security. The premature
   mortality was calculated using the life table method. Joinpoint
   regression model was used to estimate the average annual percent changes
   (AAPC) in mortality trends. Results From 2007 to 2018, the premature
   mortality from four major NCDs combined in Nanjing decreased from 15.5
   to 9.5\%, with the AAPC value at - 4.3\% (95\% CI {[}- 5.2\% to -
   3.4\%]). Overall, it can potentially achieve the target, with a relative
   reduction 28.6\%. The premature mortality from cancer, CVD, chronic
   respiratory diseases and diabetes all decreased, with AAPC values at -
   4.2, - 5.0\%, - 5.9\% and - 1.6\% respectively. A relative reduction of
   40.6 and 41.2\% in females and in rural areas, but only 21.0 and 12.8\%
   in males and in urban areas were projected. Conclusion An integrated
   approach should be taken focusing on the modifiable risk factors across
   different sectors and disciplines in Nanjing. The prevention and
   treatment of cancers, diabetes, male and rural areas NCDs should be
   enhanced.},

Abstract = {Abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein, the major component of
   neurofibrillary tangles, is critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's
   disease and related Tauopathies. We used Drosophila to examine the role
   of key disease-associated phosphorylation sites on Tau-mediated
   neurotoxicity. We present evidence that the late-appearing
   phosphorylation on Ser(238) rather than hyperphosphorylation per se is
   essential for Tau toxicity underlying premature mortality in adult
   flies. This site is also occupied at the time of neurodegeneration onset
   in a mouse Tauopathy model and in damaged brain areas of confirmed
   Tauopathy patients, suggesting a similar critical role on Tau toxicity
   in humans. In contrast, occupation of Ser(262) is necessary for
   Tau-dependent learning deficits in adult Drosophila. Significantly,
   occupation of Ser(262) precedes and is required for Ser(238)
   phosphorylation, and these temporally distinct phosphorylations likely
   reflect conformational changes. Because sequential occupation of
   Ser(262) and Ser(238) is required for the progression from Tau-mediated
   learning deficits to premature mortality in Drosophila, they may also
   play similar roles in the escalating symptom severity in Tauopathy
   patients, congruent with their presence in damaged regions of their
   brains.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increasing prevalence of young-onset diabetes,
   especially in developing areas. We compared the clinical outcomes and
   predictors for cardiovascular-renal events between Chinese patients with
   type 2 diabetes with young- or late-onset of disease diagnosed before or
   after the age of 40 years, respectively.
   METHODS: The Hong Kong Diabetes Registry was established in 1995 as an
   ongoing quality improvement initiative with consecutive enrollment of
   diabetic patients from ambulatory settings for documentation of risk
   factors, microvascular and macrovascular complications, and clinical
   outcomes using a structured protocol.
   RESULTS: In 9509 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes with a median
   (interquartile range) follow-up period of 7.5 (3.9-10.8) years, 21.3\%
   (n = 2066) had young-onset diabetes. Despite 20 years difference in age,
   patients with young-onset diabetes (mean age, 41.3 years) had a similar
   or worse risk profile than those with late-onset disease (mean age, 61.9
   years). Compared with the patients with late-onset diabetes, those with
   young-onset diabetes had lower rates of cardiovascular disease and
   chronic kidney disease for the same disease duration but a higher
   cumulative incidence of clinical events at any given age. With the use
   of stepwise Cox proportional hazard analysis, patients with young-onset
   diabetes had higher risks for cardiovascular and renal events when
   adjusted by age, but no difference in risks than in the patients with
   late-onset diabetes when further adjusted by disease duration.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with young-onset diabetes had a similar or worse
   metabolic risk profile compared with those with late-onset disease. This
   group had higher risks for cardiovascular-renal complications at any
   given age, driven by longer disease duration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Small-area socioeconomic deprivation indices in Cyprus: development and
   association with premature mortality},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {BackgroundArea-level measures of socioeconomic deprivation are important
   for understanding and describing health inequalities. The aim of this
   study was the development and validation of a small-area index of
   socioeconomic deprivation for Cypriot communities and the investigation
   of its association with the spatial distribution of all-cause premature
   adult mortality.MethodsSix area-level socioeconomic indicators were used
   from the 2011 national population census (low educational attainment,
   unemployment, not owner occupied household, single-person household,
   divorced or widowed and single-parent households). After normalization
   and standardization of the geographically smoothed indicators, Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) was used to construct indicator weights. The
   association between deprivation indices and the spatial distribution of
   all-cause premature adult mortality was estimated in Poisson log-linear
   spatial models.ResultsPCA resulted in two principal components
   explaining the 65.7\% of the total variance. The first principal
   component included four indicators (low educational attainment,
   single-person households, divorced or widowed and single-parent
   households, the latter however with a negative loading) and it thought
   more likely to capture rural-related aspects of deprivation. The second
   principal component included the other two indicators (unemployment and
   not owner occupied households) and it is more likely to capture
   urban-related aspects of material deprivation. Restricting the analysis
   in the metropolitan areas of the island resulted in a different set of
   indicators for the urban-specific deprivation index. All developed
   indices were linearly associated with all-cause premature adult
   mortality. The all-cause premature adult mortality increased by 17\% per
   1 standard deviation (SD) increase in rural-related socioeconomic
   deprivation (95\% CrI: 8-27\%) and 8\% per 1 SD increase in
   urban-related aspects of material deprivation (95\% CrI: 3-15\%) in the
   nationwide analysis and 9\% per 1 SD increase in urban-specific
   socioeconomic deprivation (95\% CrI: 4-15\%) across metropolitan
   areas.ConclusionsThe results of this study demonstrate that a set of
   small-area indices of socioeconomic deprivation across Cypriot
   communities have good construct and predictive validity. However, the
   study indicates that different aspects of socioeconomic deprivation may
   be important in rural and urban areas in Cyprus. The developed
   socioeconomic deprivation indices could offer a valid new tool for
   Cypriot public health research and policy in terms of identifying areas
   in greatest need, guiding resource allocation and developing
   area-targeted public health programmes and policies.},

Abstract = {Aim Despite the country's explicit political goal to establish
   equivalent living conditions across Germany, significant inequality
   continues to exist. We argue that premature mortality is an excellent
   proxy variable for testing the claim of equivalent living conditions
   since the root causes of premature death are socioeconomic.
   Subject and methods We analyse variation in premature mortality across
   Germany's 402 districts and cities in 2014.
   Results Premature mortality spatially clusters among geographically
   contiguous and proximate districts/cities and is higher in more urban
   places as well as in districts/cities located further north and in
   former East Germany. We demonstrate that, first, socioeconomic factors
   account for 62\% of the cross-sectional variation in years of potential
   life lost and 70\% of the variation in the premature mortality rate.
   Second, we show that these socioeconomic factors either entirely or
   almost fully eliminate the systematic spatial patterns that exist in
   premature mortality.
   Conclusion On its own, fiscal redistribution, the centrepiece of how
   Germany aspires to establish its political goal, cannot generate
   equivalent living conditions in the absence of a comprehensive set of
   economic and social policies at all levels of political administration,
   tackling the disparities in socioeconomic factors that collectively
   result in highly unequal living conditions.},

Title = {Premature mortality in active convulsive epilepsy in rural Kenya Causes

Abstract = {Objective:We estimated premature mortality and identified causes of
   death and associated factors in people with active convulsive epilepsy
   (ACE) in rural Kenya.Methods:In this prospective population-based study,
   people with ACE were identified in a cross-sectional survey and followed
   up regularly for 3 years, during which information on deaths and
   associated factors was collected. We used a validated verbal autopsy
   tool to establish putative causes of death. Age-specific rate ratios and
   standardized mortality ratios were estimated. Poisson regression was
   used to identify mortality risk factors.Results:There were 61 deaths
   among 754 people with ACE, yielding a rate of 33.3/1,000 persons/year.
   Overall standardized mortality ratio was 6.5. Mortality was higher
   across all ACE age groups. Nonadherence to antiepileptic drugs (adjusted
   rate ratio {[}aRR] 3.37), cognitive impairment (aRR 4.55), and age (50+
   years) (rate ratio 4.56) were risk factors for premature mortality. Most
   deaths (56\%) were directly related to epilepsy, with prolonged
   seizures/possible status epilepticus (38\%) most frequently associated
   with death; some of these may have been due to sudden unexpected death
   in epilepsy (SUDEP). Possible SUDEP was the likely cause in another
   7\%.Conclusion:Mortality in people with ACE was more than 6-fold greater
   than expected. This may be reduced by improving treatment adherence and
   prompt management of prolonged seizures and supporting those with
   cognitive impairment.},

Title = {Mapping distance-decay of premature mortality attributable to
   PM2.5-related traffic congestion},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Volume = {243},

Abstract = {Although several air pollution studies have examined the relationship
   between people living close to roadways and human health, we are unaware
   of studies that have examined the distance-decay of this effect based on
   a snapshot of congestion and focused on a micro-level traffic emission
   inventory. In this paper we estimate the distance-decay of premature
   mortality risk related to PM2.5 emitted by traffic congestion in
   Hamilton, Canada, in 2011 We employ the Stochastic User Equilibrium
   (SUE) traffic assignment algorithm to estimate congested travel times
   for each road link in our study area. Next, we used EPA's MOVES model to
   estimate mass of PM2.5, and then R-line dispersion model to predict
   concentration of PM2.5. Finally, we apply Integrated Exposure Response
   Function (IERF) to estimate PM2.5-related premature mortality at 100 m x
   100 m grid resolution. We estimated total premature mortality over
   Hamilton to be 73.10 (95\%CI: 39.05; 82.11) deaths per year. We observed
   that the proximity to a roadway increases the risk of premature
   mortality and the strength of this risk decreases as buffer sizes are
   increased. For example, we estimated that the premature mortality risk
   within buffer 0-100 m is 29.5\% higher than for the buffer 101-200 m,
   179.3\% higher than for the buffer 201-300 m, and 566\% higher than for
   the buffer 301-400 m. Our study provides a new perspective on exposure
   increments from traffic congestion. In particular, our findings show
   health effects gradients across neighborhoods, capturing microscale
   near-road exposure up to 2000 m of the roadway. Results from this
   research can be useful for policymakers to develop new strategies for
   the challenges of regulating transportation, land use, and air
   pollution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Introduction. In developing countries, finding valid and reliable data
   is a great challenge. The Federal Bureau of Statistics in Pakistan
   maintains a surveillance system that records vital events. Results are
   reported as the Pakistan Demographic Survey (PDS).
   Methods. The adjusted mortality data from PDS-1997 was used to estimate
   the burden of premature mortality using the healthy life year (HeaLY)
   methodology.
   Results. The burden of premature mortality for Pakistan was 367 HeaLYs
   Lost per 1000 population. More than half of the HeaLYs are being lost
   due to infection, maternal and perinatal conditions, and malnutrition.
   Conclusion. In the absence of a system maintaining reliable information
   regarding vital events, PDS provides a good alternate source of such
   information that can be used to aid policy making for health care and
   future research. (c) 2004 The Royal Institute of Public Health.

Title = {Premature mortality due to air pollution in European cities: a health

Abstract = {Summary
   Background Ambient air pollution is a major environmental cause of
   morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cities are generally hotspots for air
   pollution and disease. However, the exact extent of the health effects
   of air pollution at the city level is still largely unknown. We aimed to
   estimate the proportion of annual preventable deaths due to air
   pollution in almost 1000 cities in Europe.
   Methods We did a quantitative health impact assessment for the year 2015
   to estimate the effect of air pollution exposure (PM2 \& middot;5 and
   NO2) on natural-cause mortality for adult residents (aged >= 20 years)
   in 969 cities and 47 greater cities in Europe. We retrieved the cities
   and greater cities from the Urban Audit 2018 dataset and did the
   analysis at a 250 m grid cell level for 2015 data based on the global
   human settlement layer residential population. We estimated the annual
   premature mortality burden preventable if the WHO recommended values
   (ie, 10 \& micro;g/m3 for PM2 \& middot;5 and 40 \& micro;g/m3 for NO2)
   were achieved and if air pollution concentrations were reduced to the
   lowest values measured in 2015 in European cities (ie, 3 \& middot;7 \&
   micro;g/m3 for PM2 \& middot;5 and 3 \& middot;5 \& micro;g/m3 for NO2).
   We clustered and ranked the cities on the basis of population and
   age-standardised mortality burden associated with air pollution
   exposure. In addition, we did several uncertainty and sensitivity
   analyses to test the robustness of our estimates.
   Findings Compliance with WHO air pollution guidelines could prevent 51
   213 (95\% CI 34 036-68 682) deaths per year for PM2 \& middot;5 exposure
   and 900 (0-2476) deaths per year for NO2 exposure. The reduction of air
   pollution to the lowest measured concentrations could prevent 124 729
   (83 332-166 535) deaths per year for PM2 \& middot;5 exposure and 79 435
   (0-215 165) deaths per year for NO2 exposure. A great variability in the
   preventable mortality burden was observed by city, ranging from 0 to 202
   deaths per 100 000 population for PM2 \& middot;5 and from 0 to 73
   deaths for NO2 per 100 000 population when the lowest measured
   concentrations were considered. The highest PM2 \& middot;5 mortality
   burden was estimated for cities in the Po Valley (northern Italy),
   Poland, and Czech Republic. The highest NO2 mortality burden was
   estimated for large cities and capital cities in western and southern
   Europe. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were particularly
   sensitive to the choice of the exposure response function, but less so
   to the choice of baseline mortality values and exposure assessment
   method.
   Interpretation A considerable proportion of premature deaths in European
   cities could be avoided annually by lowering air pollution
   concentrations, particularly below WHO guidelines. The mortality burden
   varied considerably between European cities, indicating where policy
   actions are more urgently needed to reduce air pollution and achieve
   sustainable, liveable, and healthy communities. Current guidelines
   should be revised and air pollution concentrations should be reduced
   further to achieve greater protection of health in cities.},

Abstract = {Objectives Health region differences in immigration patterns and
   premature mortality rates exist in Ontario, Canada. This study used
   linked population-based databases to describe the regional proportion of
   immigrants in the context of provincial health region variation in
   premature mortality.
   Methods We analyzed all adult premature deaths in Ontario from 1992 to
   2012 using linked population files, Canadian census, and death registry
   databases. Geographic boundaries were analyzed according to 14 health
   service regions, known as Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs). We
   assessed the role of immigrant status and regional proportion of
   immigrants in the context of these health region variations and assessed
   the contribution using sex-specific multilevel negative binomial models,
   accounting for age, individual- and area-level immigration, and
   area-level material deprivation.
   Results We observed significant premature mortality variation among
   health service regions in Ontario between 1992 and 2012. Average annual
   rates ranged across LHINs from 3.03 to 6.40 per 1000 among males and
   2.04 to 3.98 per 1000 among females. The median rate ratio (RR)
   decreased for men from 1.14 (95\% CI 1.06, 1.19) to 1.07 (95\% CI 1.00,
   1.11) after adjusting for year, age, area-based material deprivation,
   and individual- and area-level immigration, and among females reduced
   from 1.13 (95\% CI 1.05,1.18) to 1.04 (95\% CI 1.00, 1.05). These
   adjustments explained 84.1\% and 94.4\% of the LHIN-level variation in
   males and females respectively. Reduced premature mortality rates were
   associated with immigrants compared with those for long-term residents
   in the fully adjusted models for both males 0.43 (95\% CI 0.42, 0.44)
   and females 0.45 (0.44, 0.46).
   Conclusion The findings demonstrate that health region differences in
   premature mortality in Ontario are in part explained by individual-level
   effects associated with the health advantage of immigrants, as well as
   contextual area-level effects that are associated with regional
   differences in the immigrant population. These factors should be
   considered in addition to health system factors when looking at health
   region variation in premature deaths.},

Abstract = {Cigarette smoking is a well-established cause of excess morbidity and
   mortality in the United States and globally. The current study builds on
   the existing literature by examining how smoking trajectories might be a
   mechanism through which adolescent tolerance for deviance predicts
   premature all-cause and tobacco-specific mortality. Participants were
   from a cohort-sequential study conducted in the Midwestern United States
   of the natural history of cigarette smoking from adolescence through
   midlife that collected nine waves of data from 1980 to 2011. For the
   current study, we selected participants who were measured at least once
   at age 18 or older and who did not die before age 24 (n = 7575).
   Participants tolerance for deviance was assessed in adolescence, smoking
   trajectory group was based on self-reported smoking status during the
   first six waves of data collection, and cause of death for deceased
   participants (n = 222) was obtained from the National Death Index.
   Mediation analyses using the joint significance test were conducted
   separately for all-cause mortality and tobacco-specific mortality.
   Adolescent tolerance for deviance significantly predicted smoking
   trajectory group over and above the influence of covariates. Adolescents
   with higher tolerance for deviance were more likely to belong to any
   smoking trajectory group compared to abstainers, and membership in a
   smoking trajectory group characterized by early onset and heavy,
   persistent smoking was related to premature all-cause and
   tobacco-specific mortality. Finally, smoking trajectory group was a
   significant mediator of the relation between adolescent tolerance for
   deviance and all-cause mortality.},

Title = {Estimates of the years-of-life-lost due to the top nine causes of death

Abstract = {Background. Years-of-life-lost (YLL) contribute nearly two-thirds of the
   disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide and are especially
   Important for India where Infant and child mortality Is still high.
   These were estimated for India under the Global Burden of Disease study
   for the year 1990. No estimates are available for the different states
   of India. We aimed to prepare state-wise estimates of YLL for different
   causes of death in rural areas and to determine the causes responsible
   for a higher burden In different states.
   Methods. Percentage deaths of the top 9 causes reported In the
   Registrar-General's Survey of Causes of Deaths (Rural)-1995 in 13 major
   states of India and different age groups was applied to the expected
   number of total deaths. The life lost according to the standard
   life-table was age-weighted and discounted using the methodology of the
   Global Burden of Disease 1990 study. The causes of death were based on
   lay reporting which otherwise seem reliable.
   Results. The all-cause YLL in rural India In 1995 were 207 per 1000
   population. The minimum was 74 In Kerala and maximum 276 in Madhya
   Pradesh. Pneumonia was the top cause responsible for 15 YLL. The
   Inter-state variation was high as Tamil Nadu had only 1.6 and Uttar
   Pradesh 30.5 YLL from this cause. Cancers were a uniform burden across
   the states. Heart attack, and bronchitis and asthma cut across the more
   and less developed states. Suicides were a heavy burden in Andhra
   Pradesh and vehicular accidents In Haryana and Rajasthan. Bihar,
   Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh had
   communicable and nutritional conditions as predominant causes while
   Kerala and Punjab had non-communicable diseases as the predominant cause
   of YLL due to premature mortality.
   Conclusion. These results provide a new perspective about the causes of
   death that need more attention In rural areas of different states of
   India. These will also help prioritize areas which require more Inputs
   at the state-level and hence will be useful for health pollcymakers.},

Title = {A Reassessment of Suicide Measurement Some Comparative PYLL-Based Trends

Abstract = {Background. Concern with suicide measurement is a positive, albeit
   relatively recent, development. A concern with ``the social loss from
   suicide{''} requires careful attention to appropriately measuring the
   phenomenon. This paper applies two different methods of measuring
   suicide data: the conventional age-standardized suicide (count) rate;
   and the alternative rate, the potential years of life lost (PYLL) rate.
   Aims. The purpose of applying these two measures is to place suicide in
   Queensland in a historical and comparative (relative to other causes of
   death) perspective. Methods. Both measures are applied to suicide data
   for Queensland since 1920. These measures are applied also to two
   ``largish{''} causes of death and two ``smaller{''} causes of death,
   i.e., circulatory diseases, cancers, motor vehicle accidents, suicide.
   Results. The two measures generate quite different pictures of suicide
   in Queensland: Using the PYLL measure, suicide is a quantitatively
   larger issue than is indicated by the count measure. Conclusions. The
   PYLL measure is the more appropriate measure for evaluation exercise of
   public health prevention strategies. This is because the PYLL measure is
   weighted by years of life lost and, thus, it incorporates more
   information than the count measure which implicitly weights each death
   with a somewhat partial value, viz. unity.},

Title = {Mortality and years of life lost to death or disability by interpersonal
   violence against women in Brazil: Global Burden of Disease Study, 1990
   and 2019},
Journal = {ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA},

Abstract = {Introduction: Aggression against women is an important cause of
   morbidity and death. This study compares the variation of deaths and
   years of life lost to death or disability (DALY) caused by interpersonal
   violence against women in Brazil and its states. Methods: This
   descriptive study analyzed estimates from the Global Burden of Disease
   Study (GBD) referring to interpersonal violence against women, aged 15
   to 49 years, examining the mortality and DALY rates for Brazil and its
   states, in 1990 and 2019. Results: In this study, 3,168 deaths of women
   between 15 and 49 years of age, caused by interpersonal violence, were
   estimated in 1990, and 4,262 in 2019, which represents an increase of
   33.8\%. Regardless of the Maria da Penha Law and the progress in
   policies for curbing violence against women, one can observe a stability
   in the mortality and DALY rates in most of the Brazilian states. Only
   Bahia had a significant increase in those rates, while Federal District,
   Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo showed a significant decline. Conclusions:
   The rates of female homicide have remained stable when comparing 1990
   and 2019. Although there were improvements in terms of women's rights in
   the early 2000's, the chauvinist and conservative society of Brazil has
   not been able to protect women, and the country might not reach the
   targets established by the UN's 2030 Agenda.},

Abstract = {Objectives Investigate the association of heat exposure on years of life
   lost (YLL) from non-communicable diseases (NCD) in Nouna, Burkina Faso,
   between 2000 and 2010.
   Design Daily time series regression analysis using distributed lag
   non-linear models, assuming a quasi-Poisson distribution of YLL.
   Setting Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Kossi
   Province, Rural Burkina Faso.
   Participants 18 367 NCD-YLL corresponding to 790 NCD deaths recorded in
   the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance Site register over 11
   years.
   Main outcome measure Excess mean daily NCD-YLL were generated from the
   relative risk of maximum daily temperature on NCD-YLL, including effects
   delayed up to 14 days.
   Results Daily average NCD-YLL were 4.6, 2.4 and 2.1 person-years for all
   ages, men and women, respectively. Moderate 4-day cumulative rise in
   maximum temperature from 36.4 degrees C (50th percentile) to 41.4
   degrees C (90th percentile) resulted in 4.44 (95\% CI 0.24 to 12.28)
   excess daily NCDYLL for all ages, rising to 7.39 (95\% CI 0.32 to 24.62)
   at extreme temperature (42.8 degrees C; 99th percentile). The strongest
   health effects manifested on the day of heat exposure (lag 0), where
   0.81 (95\% CI 0.13 to 1.59) excess mean NCD-YLL occurred daily at 41.7
   degrees C compared with 36.4 degrees C, diminishing in statistical
   significance after 4 days. At lag 0, daily excess mean NCD-YLL were
   higher for men, 0.58 (95\% CI 0.11 to 1.15) compared with women, 0.15
   (95\% CI -0.25 to 9.63) at 41.7 degrees C vs 36.4 degrees C.
   Conclusion Premature death from NCD was elevated significantly with
   moderate and extreme heat exposure. These findings have important
   implications for developing adaptation and mitigation strategies to
   reduce ambient heat exposure and preventive measures for limiting NCD in
   Africa.},

Title = {Life expectancy and expected years of life lost to oral cancer in
   Taiwan: A nation-wide analysis of 22,024 cases followed for 10 years},
Journal = {ORAL ONCOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {51},

Pages = {349-354},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives: This analysis examined the life expectancies (LE) and
   expected years of life lost (EYLL) in relation to oral cancer in Taiwan.
   Materials and methods: A semi-parametric extrapolation method was
   applied to estimate gender, age, histology, subsite, and stage
   stratified LE, EYLL of 22,024 pathologically verified oral cancer
   patients retrospectively recruited from the National Cancer Registry of
   Taiwan during 2002-2009, who were followed up to 2011.
   Results: The patients were predominantly male 20,101, (91.3\%), and over
   80\% were less than 65 years old. The mean age at diagnosis of males was
   younger than that of females (52.73 years vs. 60.76 years). The LE after
   diagnosis was longer among females than males (15.26 years vs. 12.73
   years), with a smaller loss of the corresponding EYLL (8.88 years vs.
   14.05 years), which prevails after stratification by age and stage. More
   than half of the oral cancer cases were diagnosed at a later stage, with
   2921 cases (13.3\%) of stage III and 8488 (38.5\%) of stage IV. The
   five-year overall survival rate of oral cancer for stages I, II, III,
   and IV were 78.98\%, 69.38\%, 54.62\%, and 36.17\%, respectively. The
   earlier the diagnosis, the longer the life expectancy and the smaller
   the EYLL.
   Conclusions: We concluded that early detection and early intervention of
   oral cancer can prolong life expectancy and reduce the years of life
   lost, indicating the importance of proactive screening and oral hygiene.

Title = {The Contributions of Selected Diseases to Disparities in Death Rates and
   Years of Life Lost for Racial/Ethnic Minorities in the United States,
   1999-2010},
Journal = {PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Differences in risk for death from diseases and other causes among
   racial/ethnic groups likely contributed to the limited improvement in
   the state of health in the United States in the last few decades. The
   objective of this study was to identify causes of death that are the
   largest contributors to health disparities among racial/ethnic groups.
   Methods
   Using data from WONDER system, we measured the relative (age-adjusted
   mortality ratio {[}AAMR]) and absolute (difference in years of life lost
   {[}dYLL]) differences in mortality risk between the non-Hispanic white
   population and the black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, and
   Asian/Pacific Islander populations for the 25 leading causes of death.
   Results
   Many causes contributed to disparities between non-Hispanic whites and
   blacks, led by assault (AAMR, 7.56; dYLL, 4.5 million). Malignant
   neoplasms were the second largest absolute contributor (dYLL, 3.8
   million) to black white disparities; we also found substantial relative
   and absolute differences for several cardiovascular diseases. Only
   assault, diabetes, and diseases of the liver contributed substantially
   to disparities between non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics (AAMR >= 1.65;
   dYLL >= 325,000). Many causes of death, led by assault (AAMR, 3.25;
   dYLL, 98,000), contributed to disparities between non-Hispanic whites
   and American Indians/Alaska Natives; Asian/Pacific Islanders did not
   have a higher risk than non-Hispanic whites for death from any disease.
   Conclusion
   Assault was a substantial contributor to disparities in mortality among
   non-Asian racial/ethnic minority populations. Research and intervention
   resources need to target diseases (such as diabetes and diseases of the
   liver) that affect certain racial/ethnic populations.},

Title = {Impact of birth season on the years of life lost from respiratory
   diseases in the elderly related to ambient PM2.5 exposure in Ningbo,
   China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background Ambient fine particle (PM2.5) pollution is an important
   public health problem in China. Short-term ambient PM2.5 exposure is
   associated with increased mortality of respiratory diseases. However,
   few evidence was available on the effect of exposure to ambient PM2.5 on
   the years of life lost (YLL) from respiratory diseases in the elderly.
   Furthermore, birth season which is frequently applied as a proxy for
   environmental exposure in early life may influence the health outcome in
   the later life. Nevertheless, the modification effect of birth season on
   the relationship of PM2.5 exposure and respiratory health need to be
   explored. Methods A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to
   analyze YLL from respiratory diseases in the elderly related to ambient
   PM2.5 exposure between 2013 and 2016 in Ningbo, China. The modification
   effect of birth season was explored by subgroup comparisons between
   different birth seasons. Results Each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in daily
   ambient PM2.5 was associated with an increment of 1.61 (95\% CI 0.12,
   3.10) years in YLL from respiratory diseases in the elderly population.
   Individuals who were born in winter had significantly higher YLL from
   respiratory diseases associated with ambient PM2.5 exposure than those
   who were born in other seasons. Conclusions Birth season which reflects
   the early-life PM2.5 exposure level that may influence the lung
   development has a potential effect on the disease burden of respiratory
   diseases related to ambient PM2.5 exposure in later life. The results
   would provide theoretical basis to protect vulnerable population defined
   by birth season when exploring the adverse effects of ambient PM2.5 in
   the respiratory health.},

Abstract = {Background: Increasing studies reported increased mortality risk
   associated with exposure to lower-than-standard air pollution. This
   study aimed to investigate mortality burden and life expectancy loss due
   to lower-than-standard particulate matter air pollution in Hong Kong,
   China.
   Methods: We obtained 17-year (2000-2016) daily time-series data on
   mortality, particulate matters with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 mu m
   (PM2.5) and <10 mu m (PM10). We applied a distributed lag non-linear
   model to fit the association of years of life lost (YLL) with PM2.5 and
   PM10. Total YLL attributable to PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations below
   ambient air quality standards were estimated.
   Results: We estimated 5.2\% of total YLL due to PM2.5, of which, 33.5\%,
   52.8\% and 94.5\% occurred in concentrations not exceeding the criterion
   of WHO, the USA, and China, corresponding to 0.3, 0.4 and 0.7 years loss
   in life expectancy, respectively. There was 6.9\% (annual 34434.4 YLL)
   of total YLL due to PM10, of which, 50.7\%, 50.7\%, 99.5\% and 99.5\%
   occurred in concentrations below the criterion of WHO, Europe, the USA,
   and China, which corresponded to 0.5, 0.5, 1 and 1 year loss in life
   expectancy, respectively. Assuming that PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations
   had met stricter standards, more gains in life expectancy could be
   expected in women than in men, in people aged up to 64 years than those
   of 65 years or older, and in those with respiratory disease than those
   with cardiovascular disease.
   Conclusions: Exposure to lower-than-standard particulate matters air
   pollution could shorten life expectancy and incur massive mortality
   burden in Hong Kong. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mortality and years of life lost by colorectal cancer attributable to
   physical inactivity in Brazil (1990-2015): Findings from the Global
   Burden of Disease Study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Introduction
   The aims of this study were to estimate all-cause and cause-specific
   mortality and years of life lost, investigated by disability-adjusted
   life-years (DALYs), due to colorectal cancer attributable to physical
   inactivity in Brazil and in the states; to analyze the temporal trend of
   these estimates over 25 years (1990-2015) compared with global estimates
   and according to the socioeconomic status of states of Brazil.
   Methods
   Databases from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) for Brazil,
   Brazilian states and global information were used. It was estimated the
   total number and the age-standardized rates of deaths and DALYs for
   colorectal cancer attributable to physical inactivity in the years 1990
   and 2015. We used the Socioeconomic Development Index (SDI).
   Results
   Physical inactivity was responsible for a substantial number of deaths
   (1990: 1,302; 2015: 119,351) and DALYs (1990: 31,121; 2015: 87,116) due
   to colorectal cancer in Brazil. From 1990 to 2015, the mortality and
   DALYs due to colorectal cancer attributable to physical inactivity
   increased in Brazil (0.6\% and 0.6\%, respectively) and decreased around
   the world (-0.8\% and -1.1\%, respectively). The Brazilian states with
   better socioeconomic indicators had higher rates of mortality and
   morbidity by colorectal cancer due to physical inactivity (p<0.01).
   Physical inactivity was responsible for deaths and DALYs due to
   colorectal cancer in Brazil.
   Conclusions
   Over 25 years, the Brazilian population showed more worrisome results
   than around the world. Actions to combat physical inactivity and greater
   cancer screening and treatment are urgent in the Brazilian states.},

Title = {The burden associated with ambient PM2.5 and meteorological factors in
   Guangzhou, China, 2012-2016: A generalized additive modeling of temporal
   years of life lost},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Daily exposure to ambient particulate matter with
   aerodynamic diameter <2.5 Am (PM2.5) increases deaths and is an
   important contributor to burden of disease in population. To better
   understand the disease burden associated with PM2.5, we examined the
   effects of PM2.5 on daily years of life lost (YLL) in Guangzhou, China.
   Methods: Using Guangzhou death registry, air pollution and
   meteorological database, we applied generalized additive models (GAM) to
   the relationships between YLL and PM2.5. We then adjusted the models for
   age, gender, seasonality and meteorological variables. We also conducted
   within -data prediction of YLL while setting 2012-2014 as baseline.
   Results: Over 2 million YLLs (800,137 YLLs for females and 1,212,040
   YLLs for males) were observed during 2012-2016. YLL was higher for the
   elderly people. Mean daily average PM2.5 concentration was 47.3 mu
   g/m(3). In model comparisons, the GAM with six meteorological variables
   (sunshine hours, relative humidity, precipitation, atmospheric pressure,
   wind speed, evaporation) outperformed the others. The R-2 and total
   deviance were 0.542 and 53.0\%, respectively. Non-linear trends were
   observed for PM2.5 and meteorological variables. Fitted daily YLL
   increased to the highest level, when PM2.5 concentration reached 134.3
   g/m(3) and atmospheric pressure reached 99.4 kPa. Within-data prediction
   supported the fitted GAM, where low mean absolute percentage errors were
   observed.
   Conclusions: Daily PM2.5 exposure has a nonlinear effect on YLL and
   increased levels of PM2.5 may lead to increased YLL. This study
   highlights the urge to reduce ambient PM2.5 pollution in Guangzhou, in
   order to promote environmental health. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {We examined the 16-year mortality experience among participants in the
   baseline examination (1985-86) of the Coronary Artery Risk Development
   in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a U.S. cohort of 5115 urban adults
   initially 18-30 years old and balanced by sex and race (black and
   whites) in the USA. We observed 127 deaths (annual mortality of 0.15\%).
   Compared to white women, the rate ratio (95\% confidence interval) of
   all-cause mortality was 9.3 (4.4, 19.4) among black men, 5.3 (2.5, 11.4)
   among white men and 2.7 (1.2, 6.1) among black women. The predominant
   causes of death, which also differed greatly by sex-race, were AIDS
   (28\% of deaths), homicide (16\%), unintentional injury (10\%), suicide
   (7\%), cancer (7\%) and coronary disease (7\%). The significant baseline
   predictors of all-cause mortality in multivariate analysis were male
   sex, black race, diabetes, self-reported liver and kidney disease,
   current cigarette smoking and low social support. Two other factors,
   self-reported thyroid disease and high hostility, were significant
   predictors in analyses adjusted for age, sex and race. In conclusion, we
   found striking differences in the rates and underlying cause of death
   across sex-race groups and several independent predictors of young adult
   mortality that have major implications for preventive medicine and
   social policies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have a high mortality rate,
   mainly in lower and middle income countries. The major groups are
   cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic respiratory disease (CRD), cancer
   and diabetes. The Action Plan to reduce NCDs in Brazil, 2011-2022
   established a 2\% yearly reduction in the NCD premature mortality rate
   as a goal. The aim of the study was to analyze trends in premature
   mortality rates and also show goal achievement scenarios for each
   Federal Unit (FU). A time series analysis of the standardized mortality
   rate between 2000-2011 was performed using the linear regression model.
   The average annual rate of increase and the 95\% confidence interval
   were estimated. Each FU was classified as being likely or unlikely to
   achieve the goal. The FUs likely to achieve the goal were: for CVD -
   Federal District, Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas
   Gerais, Bahia, Espirito Santo and Parana states; for CRD - Amazonas,
   Federal District and Parana. For neoplasms and diabetes, none of the FUs
   are likely to achieve the goal. The articulation of the three levels of
   government will allow the strengthening of interventions to reduce the
   determinants of NCDs and to improve access and quality in health care.},

Abstract = {Background: Although a downward trend in stroke mortality over the last
   decades has been observed in many countries, stroke remains an important
   contributor to the total burden of disease. In the present study, we
   provided additional measures, namely years of life lost (YLLs) and
   average years of life lost (AYLLs) to reflect the burden of this
   condition in Japan. Methods: We obtained stroke mortality data for Japan
   from the World Health Organization mortality database for the period
   1980-2005 to analyze trends of age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100 000
   of stroke mortality. YLLs and AYLLs were also estimated according to
   Japanese life tables. Results: Decreases in ASRs by 68\% in men and by
   74\% in women were observed at the end of this study period. In men,
   there were total of 1 684 482 YLLs in 1980; 776 350 in 1995 and 745 636
   in 2005, corresponding to an overall AYLLs for all stroke deaths of
   20.6; 11.2 and 11.7 years earlier than expected, respectively. In women,
   the respective numbers were 1 567 817 YLLs in 1980; 810 135 in 1995 and
   726 650 in 2005, corresponding to an overall AYLLs for all stroke deaths
   of 19.4; 10.5 and 10.5 years. Conclusions: The findings showed shorter
   AYLLs due to stroke in Japan, suggesting that stroke patients died from
   this condition at older age at the end of the study period. This change
   in premature mortality was consistent with decreased trend in the stroke
   mortality.},

Title = {Causes of premature mortality in Swedish drug abusers: A prospective
   longitudinal study 1970-2006},

Abstract = {Aims: To evaluate premature mortality and causes of death from young
   adulthood to middle age in a cohort of drug users followed during almost
   four decades Design: Follow-up study of a consecutive cohort of patients
   with drug abuse/dependence.
   Methods: A cohort of 561 drug abusers, admitted to a detoxification and
   short-term rehabilitation unit 1970-1978 was followed to December 31st,
   2006. Standardized interviews and hospital records with toxicological
   analyses were used for demographic data, substance use and psychiatric
   diagnoses at admission. For Follow-up analyses, autopsy protocols
   including toxicology tests and death certificates were obtained for
   assessment of causes of death which were coded according to ICD-10.
   Age-group standardized mortality ratios were calculated independently
   for both sexes.
   Results: 204 persons (36.4\%) were deceased by 2006. SMR was 5.94 for
   the cohort. Compared to an age- and gender-matched population, the risk
   of premature death was about eighteen times higher between the ages of
   20-44 and about five times higher from 45 up to the age of 69. Of 120
   (59\%) drug-related deaths, 43 were opiate overdoses, and 3 were
   overdose from amphetamine. A total of 53 (26\%) persons died violent
   deaths: 39 suicides, of which 25 were drug-related, 3 homicides and 12
   accidents. The Swedish national causes of death register underestimated
   drug-related death by 37\% and suicide by 85\% compared to the results
   from this study.
   Conclusions: The cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of
   premature often drug-related and violent death well into middle age, and
   to a great extent the drug addicts died from the same drug they had
   abused when they were first admitted for treatment. The underestimation
   of drug-related death and suicide in some national death cause registers
   could be reduced if the doctor routinely records ICD codes when issuing
   death certificates and autopsy protocols. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and

Title = {Finely Resolved On-Road PM2.5 and Estimated Premature Mortality in
   Central North Carolina},

Abstract = {To quantify the on-road PM2.5-related premature mortality at a national
   scale, previous approaches to estimate concentrations at a 12-km x 12-km
   or larger grid cell resolution may not fully characterize concentration
   hotspots that occur near roadways and thus the areas of highest risk.
   Spatially resolved concentration estimates from on-road emissions to
   capture these hotspots may improve characterization of the associated
   risk, but are rarely used for estimating premature mortality. In this
   study, we compared the on-road PM2.5-related premature mortality in
   central North Carolina with two different concentration estimation
   approaches(i) using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to
   model concentration at a coarser resolution of a 36-km x 36-km grid
   resolution, and (ii) using a hybrid of a Gaussian dispersion model,
   CMAQ, and a space-time interpolation technique to provide annual average
   PM2.5 concentrations at a Census-block level (approximate to 105,000
   Census blocks). The hybrid modeling approach estimated 24\% more on-road
   PM2.5-related premature mortality than CMAQ. The major difference is
   from the primary on-road PM2.5 where the hybrid approach estimated 2.5
   times more primary on-road PM2.5-related premature mortality than CMAQ
   due to predicted exposure hotspots near roadways that coincide with high
   population areas. The results show that 72\% of primary on-road PM2.5
   premature mortality occurs within 1,000 m from roadways where 50\% of
   the total population resides, highlighting the importance to
   characterize near-road primary PM2.5 and suggesting that previous
   studies may have underestimated premature mortality due to PM2.5 from
   traffic-related emissions.},

Abstract = {Years of life lost (YLL) is a more informative and accurate indicator
   than daily death counts for assessing air pollution related premature
   death. However, there is limited evidence available about the
   relationship of air pollution with YLL, especially in China. We
   conducted a ten-year (from January 1st, 2001 to December 31st, 2010)
   multi-district time-series study to estimate the effects of ambient
   particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 mu m in
   size (PM10) on daily non-accidental deaths and YLL in six districts of
   Tianjin, China. Meta-analysis was used to merge the results of the six
   districts. We found that the increase of PM10 was significantly
   associated with daily death and YLL in the six districts, except with
   the YLL in Heping district. 10 mu g/m(3) increases in PM10 were
   associated with the maximum increases in excess risk (ER) of death
   counts of 0.33\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.25\%, 0.41\%) at
   lag01 and in YLL of 0.80 (95\%CI: 0.47, 1.13) person year at lag01 for
   the combined effects of six districts, respectively. Moreover, the
   associations of PM10 on daily death counts and YLL were stronger in the
   elder people (>= 65 years) than those in the younger ones (<65 years).
   These findings may help to shed light on the policy-making of PM-control
   in China and provide useful information for the protection of
   susceptible population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Obesity is still defined on the basis of body mass index (BMI) and BMI
   in itself is generally accepted as a strong predictor of overall early
   mortality. However, an inverse association between BMI and mortality has
   been reported in patients with many disease states and in several
   clinical settings: hemodialysis, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension,
   stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, surgery, etc.
   This unexpected phenomenon is usually called obesity-survival paradox
   (OP). The contiguous concepts of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO, a
   phenotype having BMI a parts per thousand yen 30 but not having any
   metabolic syndrome component and having a homeostasis model assessment
   of insulin resistance, HOMA, < 2.5) and metabolically obese normal
   weight (MONW, normal-weight individuals displaying obesity-related
   phenotypic characteristics) have received a great deal of attention in
   recent years. The interactions that link MHO, MONW and OP with body
   composition, fat distribution, aging and cardiorespiratory fitness are
   other crucial areas of research. The article is an introductory
   narrative overview of the origin and current use of the concepts of MHO,
   MONW and OP. These phenomena are very controversial and appear as a
   consequence of the frail current diagnostic definition of obesity based
   only on BMI. A new commonly established characterization and
   classification of obesities based on a number of variables is needed
   urgently.},

Title = {Educational inequalities in premature mortality by region in the Belgian
   population in the 2000s},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {75},
Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {Background: In Belgium, socio-economic inequalities in mortality have
   long been described at country-level. As Belgium is a federal state with
   many responsibilities in health policies being transferred to the
   regional levels, regional breakdown of health indicators is becoming
   increasingly relevant for policy-makers, as a tool for planning and
   evaluation. We analyzed the educational disparities by region for
   all-cause and cause-specific premature mortality in the Belgian
   population.
   Methods: Residents with Belgian nationality at birth registered in the
   census 2001 aged 25-64 were included, and followed up for 10 years
   though a linkage with the cause-of-death database. The role of 3
   socio-economic variables (education, employment and housing) in
   explaining the regional mortality difference was explored through a
   Poisson regression. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) by
   educational level (EL), rate differences (RD), rate ratios (RR), and
   population attributable fractions (PAF) were computed in the 3 regions
   of Belgium and compared with pairwise regional ratios. The global PAFs
   were also decomposed into the main causes of death.
   Results: Regional health gaps are observed within each EL, with ASMRs in
   Brussels and Wallonia exceeding those of Flanders by about 50\% in males
   and 40\% in females among Belgian. Individual SE variables only
   explained up to half of the regional differences. Educational
   inequalities were also larger in Brussels and Wallonia than in Flanders,
   with RDs ratios reaching 1.8 and 1.6 for Brussels versus Flanders, and
   Wallonia versus Flanders respectively; regional ratios in relative
   inequalities (RRs and PAFs) were smaller. This pattern was observed for
   all-cause and most specific causes of premature mortality. Ranking the
   cause-specific PAFs revealed a higher health impact of inequalities in
   causes combining high mortality rate and relative inequality, with lung
   cancer and ischemic heart disease on top for all regions and both sexes.
   The ranking showed few regional differences.
   Conclusions: For the first time in Belgium, educational inequalities
   were studied by region. Among the Belgian, educational inequalities were
   higher in Brussels, followed by Wallonia and Flanders. The
   region-specific PAF decomposition, leading to a ranking of causes
   according to their population-level impact on overall inequality, is
   useful for regional policy-making processes.},

Abstract = {The health strategies of many nations include targets to reduce suicide
   rates. In several countries, because suicide rates are rising in young
   men but failing or unchanging in most other groups, achievement of
   target reductions might mask rises in potential years of life lost
   (PYLL). Analysis of routine mortality and census data for England and
   Wales, UK, shows that although age-standardised suicide rates fell by
   18\% (95\% CI 15-21) between 1981 and 1998, the PYLL before age 65 years
   increased by 5\% (4-6). National suicide reduction targets should focus
   on PYLL and overall suicide rates.},

Title = {Premature Mortality Due to Malignancies of the Kidney and Bladder in
   Japan, 1980-2010},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {12},
Pages = {464-470},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: In the present study, we examined the trends of premature
   mortality due to kidney and bladder cancers among the Japanese
   population from 1980 through 2010.
   Methods: Mortality data were obtained from the World Health Organization
   mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was estimated using
   Japanese life tables. Average lifespan shortened (ALSS) was calculated
   and defined as the ratio of years of life lost relative to the expected
   lifespan.
   Results: Over the study period, the age-standardized rates to the World
   Standard Population for deaths from kidney and bladder cancers were
   stable. The average years of life lost (AYLL) measure shows decreases of
   about 4 and 6 years of life for kidney cancer in men and women,
   respectively, and decreases of about 2 years of life for bladder cancer
   in both sexes. The ALSS shows that patients with kidney cancer lost
   21.0\% and 24.7\% of their lifespan among men and women in 1980. whereas
   respective losses were 15.3\% and 15.8\% in 2010. Also, patients with
   bladder cancer on average lost 13.5\% in men and 14.2\% in women in 1980
   and 10.8\% in men and 11.1\% in women in 2010.
   Conclusions: Our study shows favorable trends in premature mortality for
   kidney and bladder cancers in Japan over a 30-year period; however,
   patients with bladder cancer on average lost a smaller proportion of
   their lifespan compared to those with kidney cancer. The development of
   a novel ALSS measure is convenient in examination of the burden of
   premature mortality over time.},

Abstract = {Excess mortality (Delta Mort) in China due to exposure to ambient fine
   particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) was
   determined using an ensemble prediction of annual average PM2.5 in 2013
   by the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model with four emission
   inventories and observation data fusing. Estimated Delta Mort values due
   to adult ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer are 0.30, 0.73, 0.14, and
   0.13 million in 2013, respectively, leading to a total Delta Mort of 1.3
   million. Source-oriented CMAQ modeling determined that industrial and
   residential sources were the two leading sources of Delta Mort,
   contributing to 0.40 (30.5\%) and 0.28 (21.7\%) million deaths,
   respectively. Additionally, secondary ammonium ion from agriculture,
   secondary organic aerosol, and aerosols from power generation were
   responsible for 0.16, 0.14, and 0.13 million deaths, respectively. A
   30\% ?Mort reduction in China requires an average of 50\% reduction of
   PM2.5 throughout the country and a reduction by 62\%, 50\%, and 38\% for
   the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai, and Pearl River
   Delta regions, respectively. Reducing PM2.5 to the CAAQS grade II
   standard of 35 mu g m(-3) would only lead to a small reduction in
   mortality, and a more stringent standard of <15 mu g m(-3) would be
   needed for more remarkable reduction of Delta Mort.},

Abstract = {With rapid economic growth, China haswitnessed increasingly frequent and
   severe haze and smog episodes over the past decade, posing serious
   health impacts to the Chinese population, especially those in densely
   populated city clusters. Quantification of the spatial and temporal
   variation of health impacts attributable to ambient fine particulate
   matter (PM2.5) has important implications for China's policies on air
   pollution control. In this study, we evaluated the spatial distribution
   of premature deaths in China between 2000 and 2010 attributable to
   ambient PM2.5 in accord with the Global Burden of Disease based on a
   high resolution population density map of China, satellite retrieved
   PM2.5 concentrations, and provincial health data. Our results suggest
   that China's anthropogenic ambient PM2.5 led to 1,255,400 premature
   deaths in 2010, 42\% higher than the level in 2000. Besides increased
   PM2.5 concentration, rapid urbanization has attracted large population
   migration into the more developed eastern coastal urban areas,
   intensifying the overall health impact. In addition, our analysis
   implies that health burdens were exacerbated in some developing inner
   provinces with high population density (e. g. Henan, Anhui, Sichuan)
   because of the relocation of more polluting and resource-intensive
   industries into these regions. In order to avoid such national level
   environmental inequities, China's regulations on PM2.5 should not be
   loosened in inner provinces. Furthermore policies should create
   incentive mechanisms that can promote transfer of advanced production
   and emissions control technologies from the coastal regions to the
   interior regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {More than 3 million population residing in the holy city Varanasi and
   sub-urban areas is exposed to very high level of fine particulate matter
   (PM2,5) from various sources. Continuous monitoring by Central Pollution
   Control Board started only in 2015; therefore what was the pollution
   level in the past and how it has changed over the years are not known.
   We use MODIS aerosol products to infer PM2.5 and examine 15-year
   climatology. Data shows a rapid (1.5-3\% per year) increase in PM2.5 in
   the last 15 years and high (87\% days in a year) persistence of PM2,5
   above the national air quality standard. It translates to a burden of
   5700 (2800-7500) annual premature deaths (0.16\% of the population), of
   which 29\%, 18\%, 33\%, 19\% and remaining 1\% are attributed to
   ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
   acute lower respiratory infection and lung cancer respectively. If the
   region achieves the Indian (WHO) air quality standard, 1900 (3800)
   premature deaths can be avoided every year. (C) 2017 Published by

Title = {Hazardous alcohol drinking and premature mortality in Russia: a
   population based case-control study},

Pages = {2001-2009},

Abstract = {Background The reason for the low life expectancy in Russian men and
   large fluctuations in mortality are unknown. We investigated the
   contribution of alcohol, and hazardous drinking in particular, to male
   mortality in a typical Russian city.
   Methods Cases were all deaths in men aged 25-54 years living in Izhevsk
   occurring between Oct 20, 2003, to Oct 3, 2005. Controls were selected
   at random from the city population and were frequency matched to deaths
   by age. Interviews with proxy informants living in the same household as
   cases were done between Dec 11, 2003, and Nov, 16 2005, and were
   obtained for 62\% (1750/2835) of cases and 57\% (1750/3078) of controls.
   We ascertained frequency and usual amount of beer, wine, and spirits
   consumed and frequency of consumption of manufactured ethanol-based
   liquids not intended to be drunk (non-beverage alcohol), and markers of
   problem drinking. Complete information on markers of problem drinking,
   frequency of alcohol consumption, education, and smoking was available
   for 1468 cases and 1496 controls.
   Findings 751 (51\%) cases were classed as problem drinkers or drank
   non-beverage alcohol, compared with 192 (13\%) controls. The mortality
   odds ratio (OR) for these men, compared with those who either abstained
   or were non-problematic beverage drinkers, was 6.0 (95\% CI 5.0-7-3)
   after adjustment for smoking and education. The mortality ORs for
   drinking non-beverage alcohol in the past year (yes vs no) was 9.2
   (7.2-11.7) after adjustment for age. Adjustment for volume of ethanol
   consumed from beverages lowered the OR to 8.3 (6.5-10.7), and further
   adjustment for education and smoking reduced it to 7.0 (5.5-9.0). A
   strong direct gradient with mortality was seen for frequency of
   non-beverage alcohol drinking independent of volume of beverage ethanol
   consumed. 43\% of mortality was attributable to hazardous drinking
   (problem drinking or non-beverage alcohol consumption, or both) adjusted
   for smoking and education.
   Interpretation Almost half of all deaths in working age men in a typical
   Russian city may be accounted for by hazardous drinking. Our analyses
   provide indirect support for the contention that the sharp fluctuations
   seen in Russian mortality in the early 1990s could be related to
   hazardous drinking as indicated by consumption of non-beverage alcohol.},

Title = {The contribution of outdoor air pollution sources to premature mortality
   on a global scale},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Assessment of the global burden of disease is based on epidemiological
   cohort studies that connect premature mortality to a wide range of
   causes(1-5), including the long-term health impacts of ozone and fine
   particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometres
   (PM2.5)(3-9). It has proved difficult to quantify premature mortality
   related to air pollution, notably in regions where air quality is not
   monitored, and also because the toxicity of particles from various
   sources may vary(10). Here we use a global atmospheric chemistry model
   to investigate the link between prematuremortality and seven emission
   source categories in urban and rural environments. In accord with the
   global burden of disease for 2010 (ref. 5), we calculate that outdoor
   air pollution, mostly by PM2.5, leads to 3.3 (95 per cent confidence
   interval 1.61-4.81) million premature deaths per year worldwide,
   predominantly in Asia. We primarily assume that all particles are
   equally toxic(5), but also include a sensitivity study that accounts for
   differential toxicity. We find that emissions from residential energy
   use such as heating and cooking, prevalent in India and China, have the
   largest impact on premature mortality globally, being even more dominant
   if carbonaceous particles are assumed to be most toxic. Whereas in much
   of the USA and in a few other countries emissions from traffic and power
   generation are important, in eastern USA, Europe, Russia and East Asia
   agricultural emissions make the largest relative contribution to PM2.5,
   with the estimate of overall health impact depending on assumptions
   regarding particle toxicity. Model projections based on a
   business-as-usual emission scenario indicate that the contribution of
   outdoor air pollution to premature mortality could double by 2050.},

Title = {Rising premature mortality in the UK's persistently deprived areas: Only
   a Scottish phenomenon?},

Abstract = {In the international literature, many studies find strong relationships
   between area-based measures of deprivation and mortality. In the UK,
   mortality rates have generally fallen in recent decades but the life
   expectancy gap between the most and least deprived areas has widened,
   with a number of Scottish studies highlighting increased mortality rates
   in deprived areas especially in Glasgow. However, these studies relate
   health outcomes at different time points against period-specific
   measures of deprivation which may not be comparable over time. Using
   longitudinal deprivation measures where levels of area deprivation are
   made comparable over time, a recent study demonstrated how levels of
   mortality change in relation to changing or persistent levels of (non-)
   deprivation over time. The results showed that areas which were
   persistently deprived in Scotland experienced a rise in premature
   mortality rates by 9.5\% between 1981 and 2001.
   Here, focussing on persistently deprived areas we extended the coverage
   to the whole of the UK to assess whether, between 1991 and 2001, rising
   premature mortality rates in persistentl/deprived areas are a Scottish
   only phenomenon or whether similar patterns are evident elsewhere and
   for men and women separately. We found that male premature mortality
   rates rose by over 14\% in Scotland over the 10-year period between the
   early 1990s and 2000s in persistently deprived areas. We found no
   significant rise in mortality elsewhere in the UK and that the rise
   among men in Scotland was 1riven by results for Glasgow where mortality
   rates rose by over 15\% during the decade. Our analyses demonstrate the
   importance of identifying areas experiencing persistent poverty. These
   results justify even more of a public health focus on Glasgow and
   further work is needed to understand the demographic factors, such as
   health selective migration, immobility and population residualisation,
   which r ay contribute to these findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Evaluation of Between-County Disparities in Premature Mortality Due to
   Stroke in the US},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Identifying the factors associated with premature stroke
   mortality and measuring between-county disparities may provide insight
   into how to reduce variations and achieve more equitable health
   outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the between-county disparities in premature stroke
   mortality in the US, investigate county-level factors associated with
   mortality, and describe differences in mortality disparities by place of
   death and stroke subtype.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cross-sectional
   study linked the mortality and demographic data of US counties from the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database to
   county-level characteristics from multiple databases. The outcome
   measure was county-level age-adjusted stroke mortality among adults aged
   25 to 64 years in 2637 US counties from 1999 to 2018. This study was
   conducted from April 1, 2019, to October 31, 2020. Generalized linear
   Poisson regressions were fitted to investigate 4 sets of factors
   associated with county-level mortality: demographic composition,
   socioeconomic status, health care and environmental features, and
   population health. The Theil index score was calculated to assess the
   mortality disparities.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Stroke mortality was measured as the number
   of deaths attributed to stroke in the data set. Out-of-stroke-unit death
   was defined as any death occurring in outpatient or emergency
   departments or at the pretransport location. Five stroke subtypes were
   included in the analysis.
   RESULTS Although mortality did not change substantially from 1999 to
   2018 (from 12.62 to 11.81 per 100 000 population), the proportion of
   deaths occurring out of the stroke unit increased from 23.56\% (4328 of
   18 369) to 34.57\% (6978 of 20 188). A large percentage of stroke of an
   uncertain cause was reported, with most deaths (55.20\%) occurring out
   of the stroke unit. In the county with the highest premature stroke
   mortality, the incidence was 20.78 times as high as that in the county
   with the lowest mortality (65.04 vs 3.13 deaths per 100 000 population).
   The highest between-county disparities were found for stroke of
   uncertain cause. For out-of-stroke-unit death, county-level mortality
   was largely associated with demographic composition (31.6\%) and health
   care and environmental features (25.8\%). For in-hospital death, 29.8\%
   of county-level mortality was associated with population health and
   28.7\% was associated with demographic composition.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that strategies
   addressing specific factors that underlie the mortality disparities
   among US counties, especially for out-of-stroke-unit death and stroke of
   uncertain cause, may be useful when tailored to the county-level context
   before implementing interventions for the neediest counties.},

Abstract = {Climate change modulates the concentration of fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) via modifying atmospheric circulation, temperature, and the
   hydrological cycle. Furthermore, PM2.5 is associated with
   cardiopulmonary diseases and premature mortality. Here, we use seven
   models to assess the response of PM2.5 to end of the twenty-first
   century climate change under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5,
   and the corresponding impact on premature mortality. The majority of
   models yield an increase in both PM2.5 and premature mortality
   associated with lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease in all world
   regions except Africa. These results are robust across five different
   future population projections, although the magnitude of premature
   deaths can vary by up to a factor of two. Much larger uncertainty is
   related to uncertainty in model physics and the representation of
   aerosol processes. Although our analysis requires several assumptions
   related to future population estimates, as well as the
   concentration-response function, results suggest that future emission
   reductions are necessary to avoid the likely health risks associated
   with increasing PM2.5 in a warmer world.},

Title = {Lifting the shroud on depression and premature mortality: A 49-year
   follow-up study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have shown higher rates of death from natural causes in
   the years immediately following an episode of clinical depression. The
   longer term relationship of depression to excess mortality is less clear
   because relatively few studies have followed the same cohort of patients
   for more than 10 years. The present paper reports on the findings
   following the same cohort of patients 49 years after discharge.
   Method: Patients who were diagnosed with depression in the
   Chichester/Salisbury Catchment Area Study were followed for 49 years.
   The incidence of death from natural causes in the clinical population
   was compared with population rates adjusted for age and sex.
   Results: The results suggest that clinical depression may have enduring
   effects on physical health that emerge later in life, the significance
   of which have so far remained undetected. Further analyses of death
   rates by age and sex suggest that:
   a.) Depression has a stronger impact on mortality among women.
   b.) Excess mortality starts to emerge at an earlier age among women.
   Discussion: Because prior studies of depression and mortality have
   typically followed patients for fewer than 25 years, the long-term
   impact of major depression has remained undetected. The results are
   consistent with the view that depression has a negative impact on health
   that spans multiple decades.
   Limitations: The association between mortality and depression could
   arise if prolonged treatment with antidepressant medication increases
   mortality. The association found between depression and mortality might
   also reflect differences in the quality of medical care that is provided
   to clinically depressed individuals. The present study does not control
   for factors that are confounded with depression (e.g., diet, exercise),
   nor does it utilize a matched control group.
   Conclusion: The pathways linking depression and mortality are likely to
   be complex and multifactorial in nature. The major implication of the
   present work is to suggest that such pathways link depression with
   long-term, as well as short-term differences in mortality. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Background: In this study, we investigated whether there has been an
   improvement in premature mortality due to central nervous system (CNS)
   cancers among the Canadian population from 1980 through 2010. Methods:
   Mortality data for CNS cancers were obtained from World Health
   Organization mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was estimated
   using Canadian life tables. Average lifespan shortened (ALSS) was
   calculated and defined as the ratio of YLL relative to the expected
   lifespan. Results: Over this study period, we observed decreases in age
   standardized rates to the World Standard Population for mortality due to
   CNS cancers from 5.3 to 4.1 per 100,000 men, and from 3.6 to 2.9 per
   100,000 women. Average YLL decreased from 23.6 to 21.5 years of life
   among men, and from 27.0 to 23.1 years among women in 1980 and 2010,
   respectively. The ALSS showed that men with CNS cancers lost 30.1\% of
   their life span and women lost 32.5\% in 1980, whereas they lost 25.8
   and 26.6\% in 2010, respectively. Conclusion: Our study shows that
   Canadian people with CNS cancers have had their lives prolonged at the
   end of the study period. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Sex and Racial/Ethnic Differences in Premature Mortality Due to HIV:
   Florida, 2000-2009},

Abstract = {Objective. This study aimed to characterize premature mortality among
   people diagnosed with HIV infection from 2000 to 2009 in Florida, by sex
   and race/ethnicity, to estimate differences in premature mortality that
   could be prevented by linkage to HIV care and treatment.
   Methods. Florida surveillance data for HIV diagnoses (excluding
   concurrent AIDS diagnoses) were linked with vital records-data to
   ascertain deaths through 2011. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) were
   obtained from the expected number of remaining years of life at a given
   age from the U.S. sex-specific period life tables.
   Results. Among 41,565 people diagnosed with HIV infection during the
   study period, 5,249 died, and 2,563 (48.8\%) deaths were due to
   HIV/AIDS. Age-standardized YPLL (aYPLL) due to HIV/AIDS per 1,000
   person-years was significantly higher for females than males (372.6,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 349.8, 396.2 vs. 295.2, 95\% Cl 278.4,
   312.5); for non-Hispanic black (NHB) females than non-Hispanic white
   (NHW) and Hispanic females (388.2, 95\% Cl 360.7, 416.9; 294.3, 95\% Cl
   239.8, 354.9; and 295.0, 95\% Cl 242.9, 352.5, respectively); and for
   NHB males compared with NHW and Hispanic males (378.7, 95\% Cl 353.7,
   404.7; 210.6, 95\% Cl 174.3, 250.8; and 240.9, 95\% Cl 204.8, 280.2,
   respectively). In multilevel modeling controlling for individual
   factors, NHB race was associated with YPLL due to HIV/AIDS for women
   (p=0.04) and men (p<0.001).
   Conclusion. Among people diagnosed with HIV infection, females and NHB
   people had a disproportionately high premature mortality from HIV/AIDS,
   suggesting the need for enhanced efforts to improve linkage to and
   retention in care and medication adherence for these groups.},

Abstract = {Objective To determine the mortality for persons with epilepsy and
   schizophrenia by absolute and relative measures. Methods This is a
   population-based nationwide cohort study of persons born in Denmark from
   1960 to 1987 who were alive and residing in Denmark on their 25th
   birthday. We identified persons diagnosed with epilepsy and
   schizophrenia prior to their 25th birthday and followed them to death,
   emigration, or December 31, 2012, whichever came first. The primary
   outcome was overall mortality. Data were analyzed using Cox regressions.
   Results Persons were followed for 24 167 573 person years; the median
   was 15 years. The mortality rate ratio was 4.4 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] = 4.1-4.7) for persons with epilepsy, 6.6 (95\% CI = 6.1-7.1) for
   persons with schizophrenia, and 12.8 (95\% CI = 9.1-18.1) for persons
   with both disorders, compared with persons without these disorders. The
   estimated cumulative mortality at the age of 50 years was 3.1\% (95\% CI
   = 3.0-3.1) for persons without epilepsy and schizophrenia, 10.7\% (95\%
   CI = 9.7-11.8) for persons with epilepsy, 17.4\% (95\% CI = 16.0-18.8)
   for persons with schizophrenia, and 27.2\% (95\% CI = 15.7-40.1) for
   persons with both disorders. Significance Persons with epilepsy and
   schizophrenia have very high mortality; more than one in four persons
   with both disorders died between the age of 25 and 50 years, indicating
   that these patients need special clinical attention.},

Title = {Cost of premature mortality attributable to smoking in the Middle East

Abstract = {Background,: Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of premature mortality,
   incurring substantial economic costs.
   Aims: To estimate the rate and cost of premature mortality attributable
   to smoking in the 24 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries in
   2015.
   Methods: Smoking attributable fractions were estimated. Twenty-four
   smoking-related diseases were included in the analysis. For each
   country, the total number of deaths by disease, age, and gender among
   individuals aged >= 15 years were derived from a World Health
   Organization database. Human capital approach was used in calculating
   cost of premature mortality.
   Results: Smoking was responsible for 465 285 deaths in MENA countries,
   resulting in 7 122 706 years of potential life lost, or an average of
   15.23 years lost per smoking-related death. Of the total 465 285
   smoking-related deaths, 412 415 (88.6\%) occurred in men, accounting for
   37\% of all deaths from the diseases considered in this analysis among
   men. The total mortality cost attributable to smoking was estimated at
   US\$ 29.7 billion in 2015 (0.76\% of MEN/Vs gross domestic product).
   Turkey was the country most affected by the tobacco epidemic,
   representing 41\% of smoking-related mortality cost in the whole region,
   followed by Saudi Arabia (8.76\%) and Egypt (7.88\%).
   Conclusion: Smoking is an important preventable cause of premature
   mortality in MENA countries. Substantial decline in smoking-attributable
   deaths and significant economic cost saving can be achieved in this
   region through more effective tobacco control policies.},

Title = {THE COST OF LOST PRODUCTIVITY DUE TO FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM
   DISORDER-RELATED PREMATURE MORTALITY},

Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Background
   Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) have increased
   mortality as compared to the general population.
   Objectives
   To estimate the productivity losses due to premature mortality of
   individuals with FASD in Canada in 2011.
   Methods
   A demographic approach with a counterfactual scenario in which nobody in
   Canada is born with FASD was used. Population estimates were calculated
   using data on the labour force, unemployment rate, and average weekly
   wage obtained from Statistics Canada. The number of FASD-related deaths,
   coded in the International Classification of Diseases, version 10, was
   estimated based on data from Statistics Canada and pooled prevalence
   estimates of the major disease conditions associated with FASD were
   obtained from a meta-analysis. The estimates of FASD-related mortality
   rates served as a basis for the length of working life span estimation.
   Once the number of working years lost to premature deaths was derived,
   productivity losses were computed.
   Results
   It was estimated that in total 327 individuals with FASD aged 20 to 69
   (almost twice as many men as women) died in Canada in 2011. As a result,
   there were 2,877 years of potential employment lost, which translated to
   a loss ranging from \$88 million to \$126 million. This amount
   represents the increase in national income, had there been no premature
   mortality from FASD and the workers with FASD had been typical members
   of the labour force (without compromised productivity due to FASD).
   Conclusions
   The estimates of productivity losses further reinforce the value of FASD
   prevention as a primary strategy.},

Abstract = {We conducted a multicity time-series study using monitoring data to
   assess seasonal patterns of short-term ozone-mortality association among
   elderly aged 65 years and over in Japan. Daily exposure to ambient ozone
   was computed using hourly measurements of photochemical oxidants
   available at multiple monitoring stations in each city. Effects of ozone
   on daily all-cause non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory
   mortality were estimated using distributed lag linear models,
   controlling for confounding by temporal, day of the week, temperature,
   and flu epidemics. City-level effect estimates were combined using
   inverse variance meta-analysis. In spring and autumn, a 10-ppbv increase
   of daily maximum 8-h average ozone concentration in the previous 3 days
   was associated with 0.69 \% (95 \% confidence interval (CI): 0.27-1.10),
   1.07 \% (0.34-1.82), and 1.77 \% (0.78-2.77) increases in daily
   all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively.
   Forward displacement of respiratory mortality was large during the cold
   season despite lower ozone concentration. Results were generally
   independent of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. Findings
   suggest significant mortality effects of short-term ozone exposure among
   the elderly during the moderate season. Those with underlying
   respiratory diseases were susceptible, even during winter.},

Abstract = {Childhood intelligence has been shown to predict mortality risk in
   adulthood. This relation has never been investigated in a Central
   European country with universal health care. The present study
   investigated whether childhood intelligence predicts mortality risk
   across 40 years in Luxembourg. 2543 participants completed an
   intelligence test at age 12 in 1968, and the mortality rate in this
   sample until 2008 was recorded. Our results showed that higher childhood
   intelligence predicted a lower risk for mortality, even when childhood
   socioeconomic status was controlled for. This effect was strongest in
   men belonging to the group of the lowest 20\% in intelligence. These
   results indicate that even universal access to health care cannot fully
   offset the cumulative effects of intelligence on mortality. (C) 2015

   death and the increase in AIDS itself. This study was carried out to
   determine the trends in premature mortality due to selected causes in
   Italy.
   Methods. Data from the Italian Mortality Data Base, for the ten years
   from 1984 to 1993 (the first decade of the AIDS epidemic) were analysed.
   Premature mortality was measured in terms of years of potential life
   lost before the age of 70 years (YPLL), excluding infant mortality.
   Trends in premature mortality due to AIDS were compared with those of
   the principal causes of premature death: lung cancer, colon-rectum
   cancer, stomach cancer, leukaemia, female breast cancer, uterine cancer,
   myocardial infarction, stroke, liver diseases, suicide, road accidents
   and overdose.
   Results. In this period there has been a marked increase in premature
   mortality from AIDS both among males aged 1-69 years (from a rate of
   YPLL of 0.01 per 1000 in 1984 to 3.71 in 1993) and females of the same
   age group (from 0 deaths in 1984 to a rate of YPLL of 1.02). Throughout
   the same period all the other causes of premature death have been
   declining, with the exception of suicide and overdose among males, and
   overdose and lung cancer among females, For people aged 25-44 years,
   AIDS has become the greatest cause of premature death. The increasing
   trend in premature mortality due to AIDS is most pronounced in the
   northern and central areas of Italy.
   Conclusions. AIDS is the leading cause of death among males aged 25-44
   years in Italy and is having an important impact on premature mortality
   among females in the same age group.},

Abstract = {It is known that people with personality disorders die prematurely. This
   may be connected to high levels of co-morbidity with other psychiatric
   disorders. To test whether mortality was independent, deaths were
   examined in a 31-year cohort study of anxious and depressed patients
   (Nottingham Study of Neurotic Disorder) who also had their personality
   status assessed at baseline. The severity of personality disturbance was
   assessed using a method previously used to separate personality
   disorders into ICD-11 categories. Over the follow-up period, 71 of the
   cohort of 201 patients had died. Age at death was 5.1 (M) and 5.2 (F)
   years younger in those with personality disorder compared with no
   personality disorder, but after adjusting for age at randomization and
   clinical diagnosis at baseline, these differences reduced to 1.5 (M) and
   1.6 (F) years. The longevity of the group was 12 to 18 years less than
   the general population (p < 0.0001), reinforcing previous findings of
   premature mortality in common mental illness. Analysis of causes of
   death showed no meaningful differences in personality groups. The
   hypothesis that premature death in personality disturbance is
   independent of mental health status was not supported in this study,
   despite other evidence from this cohort that general clinical outcome is
   worse in those with personality disorder. (c) 2019 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {During a two year community-based investigation of mortality 3.5\% of
   the deaths to individuals over the age of 5 rears were reported by
   bereaved relatives to have occurred to epileptics and 77\% of these
   deaths were thought to have occurred whilst the patient was in status
   epilepticus. This prompted us to determine the prevalence of epilepsy in
   this rural population by interviewing 7,450 residents of a pre defined
   study area. The prevalence of `Kifafa' or `Vitsala', two local words
   used to describe epilepsy, but later confirmed through detailed
   interviews, was 0.4\%. This prevalence is clearly an underestimate of
   the true prevalence of epilepsy in this population but is probably
   higher than. prevalences reported in developed countries.
   Anti-convulsant prophylaxis is available at the district hospital but
   this service is only sporadically used by epileptics in this population.
   Uncontrolled and poorly managed epilepsy may result in an increased risk
   of premature mortality among epileptics living in this community.},

Abstract = {Background: Both smoking and obesity increase mortality, however, only
   few studies have considered premature death. The joint effect of smoking
   and obesity is less studied. The aim of this study was to examine the
   joint associations of smoking and obesity with all-cause and cancer
   mortality among midlife employees. Methods: Baseline mail surveys among
   employees of the City of Helsinki, Finland, during 2000-2002 include
   data on smoking (never-, ex-, moderate and heavy), BMI (non-obese,
   obese), and covariates (N = 8960, response rate 67\%). Data were linked
   with register data on mortality until 2013. The final sample included
   6437 employees. Cox proportional hazard models were used. Finally
   synergistic interaction effect was examined. Results: Adjusting for age
   and gender, non-obese heavy smokers had an elevated risk of all-cause
   mortality (HR 2.98, 95\% CI 2.05-4.32). The joint association of obesity
   and smoking with all-cause mortality was stronger (HR 3.46, 95\% CI
   1.87-6.40), but there was no synergistic interaction (Synergy Index
   0.9). Non-obese heavy smokers had an elevated cancer mortality (HR 2.94,
   95\% CI 1.79-4.82). The joint association of obesity and smoking with
   cancer mortality was stronger (HR 4.57, 95\% CI 2.14-9.76) suggesting a
   synergistic interaction (Synergy Index 1.6, NS). Ex-smokers' risk of
   death was not elevated irrespective of their weight status. Conclusions:
   Smoking increases the risk of death, and obesity strengthens this
   association. Quitting smoking, especially among obese people, may reduce
   premature mortality.},

Abstract = {Background There is a west-east mortality gradient in Europe, more
   pronounced in men. The objective of this article was to quantify the
   contribution of alcohol use to the gap in premature adult mortality
   between three old (France, Sweden and United Kingdom) and four new
   (Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania and Poland) European Union (EU)
   member states for the year 2002. Russia was added as an external
   comparator.
   Methods Exposure data were taken from surveys and per capita consumption
   records from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Alcohol
   Database. Mortality data were taken from the WHO databank. The risk
   relationships were taken from published meta-analyses and from the WHO
   Comparative Risk Assessment project. Alcohol exposure and relative risk
   information was combined to derive alcohol-attributable fractions for
   relevant causes of premature mortality.
   Results Alcohol consumption was responsible for 14.6\% of all premature
   adult mortality in the eight countries, 17.3\% in men and 8.0\% in
   women. This proportion was clearly higher in the new EU member states
   and Russia compared with the comparison countries from the old EU. For
   men, Russia with 29.0 alcoholattributable premature deaths per 10000
   population had a more than 10-fold higher rate compared with Sweden (2.7
   deaths/10000). For women, the ratio between Hungary (5.0 alcohol-
   attributable deaths/10000) and Russia (4.7 deaths/10000) compared with
   Sweden (0.5 deaths/10000) was almost as high, but the rates were much
   lower. The Czech Republic and Poland showed proportionally less
   alcohol-attributable premature mortality than the other new EU member
   states or Russia for both genders, which, however, was still higher than
   in any of the old EU member states.
   Conclusions Alcohol is a strong contributor to the health gap between
   western and central and eastern Europe, with both average volume of
   consumption and patterns of drinking contributing to burden of disease
   and injury. Alcohol also contributes substantially to male-female
   differences in mortality and life expectancy. However, there are
   feasible and cost-effective measures to reduce alcohol-related burden
   that should be implemented in central and eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to examine changes in the
   distribution of causes of death and mortality rates among psychiatric
   patients visiting a psychiatric emergency room (PER), to determine
   clinically useful predictors for avoiding premature mortality among
   these patients and to discuss possible interventions.
   Method: The study was designed as a historical prospective record
   linkage study of patients with at least one visit to a Danish PER in
   1995-2007. Five consecutive 3-year cohorts of individuals aged 20 to
   <80years were identified. Data from the Danish Civil Registration System
   were linked to the Cause of Death Register and the Central Psychiatric
   Research Register, and logistic predictor analyses for premature death
   were performed.
   Results: The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of all visitors compared
   to the general Danish population was approximately 5. Overall, patients
   with drug and/or alcohol use disorder experienced at least a twofold
   increase in SMR compared to patients without substance use disorder. In
   the case of patients with schizophrenia and a concurrent substance use
   disorder, the SMR increased considerably. During the period, substance
   use disorder was the strongest predictor of premature death among
   visitors to a PER (odds ratio (OR) = 1.8; 95\% confidence interval (CI)
   = 1.5, 2.2).
   Conclusion: Persons visiting the PER had an increased SMR and substance
   use disorders were the strongest predictor of premature death within
   3years. However, death caused by substance use disorder is preventable,
   and PERs are ideal points of early intervention. Systematic screening
   for substance use disorder at the PER and/or crisis intervention teams
   may be effective intervention strategies.},

Abstract = {Background. In Poland, as in most other European countries, diseases of
   the respiratory system are the 4th leading cause of mortality; they are
   responsible for about 8\% of all deaths in the European Union (EU)
   annually. To assess the socio-economic aspects of mortality, it has
   become increasingly common to apply potential measures rather than
   conventionally used ratios.
   Objectives. The aim of this study was to analyze years of life lost due
   to premature deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory system in
   Poland from 1999 to 2013.
   Material and methods. The study was based on a dataset of 5,606,516
   records, obtained from the death certificates of Polish residents who
   died between 1999 and 2013. The information on deaths caused by diseases
   of the respiratory system, i.e., coded as 100-J99 according to the
   International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
   Problems, 10 revision (ICD-10), was analyzed. The Standard Expected
   Years of Life Lost (SEYLL) indicator was used in the study.
   Results. In the years 1999-2013, the Polish population suffered 280,519
   deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory system (4.69\% of all
   deaths). In the period analyzed, a gradual decrease in the standardized
   death rate was observed - from 46.31 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1999 to
   41.02 in 2013. The dominant causes of death were influenza and pneumonia
   (109-J18) and chronic lower respiratory diseases (J140-147). Diseases of
   the respiratory system were the cause of 4,474,548.92 lost life years.
   The Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per person (SEYLLp) was 104.72
   per 10,000 males and 52.85 per 10,000 females. The Standard Expected
   Years of Life Lost per death (SEYLLd) for people who died due to
   diseases of the respiratory system was 17.54 years of life on average
   for men and 13.65 years on average for women.
   Conclusions. The use of the SEYLL indicator provided significant
   information on premature mortality due to diseases of the respiratory
   system, indicating the fact that they play a large role in the health
   status of the Polish population.},

Title = {Premature mortality in epilepsy and the role of psychiatric comorbidity:
   a total population study},

Abstract = {Background Epilepsy is associated with high rates of premature
   mortality, but the contribution of psychiatric comorbidity is uncertain.
   We assessed the prevalence and risks of premature mortality from
   external causes such as suicide, accidents, and assaults in people with
   epilepsy with and without psychiatric comorbidity.
   Methods We studied all individuals born in Sweden between 1954 and 2009
   with inpatient and outpatient diagnoses of epilepsy (n=69 995) for risks
   and causes of premature mortality. Patients were compared with
   age-matched and sex-matched general population controls (n=660 869) and
   unaffected siblings (n=81 396). Sensitivity analyses were done to
   investigate whether these odds differed by sex, age, seizure types,
   comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, and different time periods after
   epilepsy diagnosis.
   Findings 6155 (8.8\%) people with epilepsy died during follow-up, at a
   median age of 34.5 (IQR 21.0-44.0) years with substantially elevated
   odds of premature mortality (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] of 11.1 {[}95\%
   CI 10.6-11.6] compared with general population controls, and 11.4
   {[}10.4-12.5] compared with unaffected siblings). Of those deaths,
   15.8\% (n=972) were from external causes, with high odds for non-vehicle
   accidents (aOR 5.5, 95 \% CI 4.7-6.5) and suicide (3.7, 3.3-4.2). Of
   those who died from external causes, 75.2\% had comorbid psychiatric
   disorders, with strong associations in individuals with co-occurring
   depression (13.0, 10.3-16.6) and substance misuse (22.4, 18.3-27.3),
   compared with patients with no epilepsy and no psychiatric comorbidity.
   Interpretation Reducing premature mortality from external causes of
   death should be a priority in epilepsy management. Psychiatric
   comorbidity plays an important part in the premature mortality seen in
   epilepsy. The ability of health services and public health measures to
   prevent such deaths requires review.},

Title = {Influenza-attributable years of life lost in older adults in a

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate influenza-attributable
   years of life lost (YLL) in older adults in subtropical Hefei, China
   during the years 2012-2017, based on a competing risks approach.
   Methods: The quasi-Poisson model was fitted to weekly numbers of
   all-cause deaths by 5-year age groups for older adults >= 60 years of
   age. The product of the weekly influenza-like illness consultation rate
   and the proportion of specimens that tested positive for influenza was
   taken as the measurement of influenza activity, which was incorporated
   into the model as an exploratory variable. Excess deaths associated with
   influenza were calculated by subtracting baseline deaths (setting
   influenza activity to zero) from fitted deaths. Influenza-attributable
   YLL accounting for competing risks was estimated using restricted mean
   lifetime survival analysis.
   Results: The annual influenza-attributable YLL was highest in the 75-79
   years age group (565 per 100,000 persons, 95\% confidence interval
   550-580), followed by the 80-84, 70-74, 85-89, 65-69, and 60-64 years
   age groups. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was associated with higher YLL than
   A(H1N1) and B viruses. Influenza-attributable YLL accounted for
   1.03-1.53\% of total YLL, and the proportion would be overestimated to
   2.91-7.34\% if the traditional Kaplan-Meier method ignoring competing
   risks was used.
   Conclusions: Although influenza-associated mortality increased with age,
   influenza-attributable YLL was found to be highest in the 75-79 years
   age group. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Title = {Projected Temperature-Related Years of Life Lost From Stroke Due To
   Global Warming in a Temperate Climate City, Asia Disease Burden Caused

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Global warming has attracted worldwide attention.
   Numerous studies have indicated that stroke is associated with
   temperature; however, few studies are available on the projections of
   the burden of stroke attributable to future climate change. We aimed to
   investigate the future trends of stroke years of life lost (YLL)
   associated with global warming.
   Methods-We collected death records to examine YLL in Tianjin, China,
   from 2006 to 2011. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson regression
   model after controlling for trends, day of the week, relative humidity,
   and air pollution. We estimated temperature-YLL associations with a
   distributed lag nonlinear model. These models were then applied to the
   local climate projections to estimate temperature-related YLL in the
   2050s and 2070s. We projected temperature-related YLL from stroke in
   Tianjin under 19 global-scale climate models and 3 different greenhouse
   gas emission scenarios.
   Results-The results showed a slight decrease in YLL with percent
   decreases of 0.85\%, 0.97\%, and 1.02\% in the 2050s and 0.94\%, 1.02\%,
   and 0.91\% in the 2070s for the 3 scenarios, respectively. The increases
   in heat-related annual YLL and the decreases in cold-related YLL under
   the high emission scenario were the strongest. The monthly analysis
   showed that the most significant increase occurred in the summer months,
   particularly in August, with percent changes > 150\% in the 2050s and up
   to 300\% in the 2070s.
   Conclusions-Future changes in climate are likely to lead to an increase
   in heat-related YLL, and this increase will not be offset by adaptation
   under both medium emission and high emission scenarios. Health
   protections from hot weather will become increasingly necessary, and
   measures to reduce cold effects will also remain important.},

   joint contributions of distal (historical and demographic
   characteristics) and proximal (closer to the time of the death)
   predictors of mortality. We also tested whether proximal variables were
   potential mediators of the effects of distal variables on mortality.
   Methods: Participants were 1,354 serious juvenile offenders, 45 (3.32\%)
   of whom were deceased by the completion of the study. Data were
   collected through self-reports and official records.
   Results: Significant distal predictors of mortality were being
   African-American and having a history of substance use disorder.
   Proximal predictors that added significantly to prediction included gun
   carrying, gang membership, and substance use problems. Potential
   mediators of the effects of substance use disorder history were
   continuing substance use problems and gang membership. However, proximal
   variables could not explain the heightened risk for African-Americans.
   Conclusions: Gang membership, gun carrying, and substance use problems
   are risk factors for early mortality among juvenile offenders, but they
   do not explain the elevated risk for death among African-Americans.
   Thus, further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying
   risk for premature death among African-American adolescent offenders.

Abstract = {The current study estimates premature mortality caused by long-term
   exposure to elevated concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with
   aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 mu m) in Japan from 2006
   to 2009. The premature mortality is calculated based on a relative risk
   of 1.04 (95 \% CI, 1.01-1.08) per 10 mu gm(-3) increase above the annual
   mean limit of 10 mu gm(-3) taken from the World Health Organization Air
   Quality Guidelines. The spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 are estimated
   based on the measurements of suspended particulate matter (SPM) (with
   aerodynamic diameter approximately less than 7.0 mu m) at 1,843
   monitors. The improvements of air quality in Japan by reducing the
   emissions of SPM from 2006 to 2009 could save 3,602 lives based on a
   reduction target of 10 mu gm(-3) annual mean concentration. This finding
   could be a tangible benefit gained by reducing the emissions of
   particulate matter in Japan.},

Title = {Construction of AQHI based on the exposure relationship between air
   pollution and YLL in northern China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {710},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {The current air quality index (AQI) has been argued for failing to
   respond to the combined health effects of multiple air pollutants.Thus,
   it is a challenge to construct a new indicator, air quality health index
   (AQHI) to comprehensively assess and predict air quality and the health
   effects caused by air pollution. Here, we have comprehensively
   considered the relationship between six air pollutants and the total
   mortality. And we constructed AQHI using the principal component
   analysis (FCA) by taking into account of the associations between six
   main air pollutants and YLL in Tianjin, China from 2014 to 2017. Then,
   we used the K-fold cross-validation method and the method of comparing
   AQHI with AQI to assess the validity of AQHI. respectively. Two
   principal components (F-1 and F-2) were used to construct AQHI; the
   cumulative contribution rate of variance for them was >70\% (53.6\% and
   16.4\%, respectively). With each unit increase of F-1, the total daily
   YLL increased by 18.420 person-years. With each unit increase of F-2,
   the total daily YLL increased by 22.409 person-years. The correlation
   between the predicted and actual values of total mortality and total YLL
   of AQHI was 0.742 (P< 0.001) and 0.700 (P < 0.001), respectively. The
   difference between AQI and AQHI was statistically significant (chi(2) =
   103.15, P < 0.001). There was a correlation between AQHI and AQI (r =
   0.807, P < 0.01), and the grading was also correlated (r(s) = 0.580, P <
   0.01). With an increase of interquartile range (IQR) for AQHI, the daily
   YLL increased by 32.797 (95\% CI: 14.559, 51.034), while for the AQI,
   the daily YLL increased by 22.367 (95\% CI: 6.619, 38.116), which was
   less than AQHI. These results imply that AQHI can comprehensively
   consider the impact of various pollutants on disease mortality and YLL,
   and can comprehensively reflect air quality, which has an important
   practical significance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objectives In 2018, South Korea's suicide mortality rate was 26.59
   deaths per 100 000 people; this figure is 2.2 times higher than that of
   the year 2000, during which 12.22 deaths per 100 000 people were
   ascribed to suicide. This study aims to observe the trend of disease
   burden in years of life lost (YLL) due to suicide from 2000 to 2018 in
   South Korea and investigate the related sociodemographic risk factors.
   Design This quantitative research used secondary data-including claim
   data, cause of death statistics, life tables and census data-from
   national health insurance corporation and Statistics Korea. Based on the
   methodology of Korean National Burden of Disease study, this study used
   an incidence-based approach to measure YLL.
   Results The total YLL due to suicide during the last two decades was 4
   298 886 years; the average YLL per death was 18.65 years. The YLL rate
   per 100 000 people was 482 (male: 664, female: 300) in 2018, 1.7 times
   higher than the 387 (male 387, female 183) in 2000. Low education levels
   and non-marital status were shown to be related to the increase in YLL
   rate.
   Conclusion These results show the increasing disease burden of suicide
   in South Korea and suggest the necessity of more in-depth research to
   analyse correlation and causation with sociodemographic risk factors.},

Title = {Continuous increases of surface ozone and associated premature mortality
   growth in China during 2015-2019},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Ambient ozone (O-3) pollution has become a big issue in China. Recent
   studies have linked long- and short-term O-3 exposure to several public
   health risks. In this study, we (1) characterize the long-term and
   short-term O-3-attributed health metric in China from 2015 to 2019; (2)
   estimate the surface O-3 trends; and (3) quantify the long-term and
   short-term health impacts (i.e. all-cause, cardiovascular and
   respiratory mortality) in 350 urban Chinese cities. In these 5-years,
   the national annual average of daily maximum 8 h average (AVGDMA8) O-3
   concentrations and warm-season (April-September) 4th highest daily
   maximum 8 h average (4DMA8) O-3 concentrations increased from 74.0 +/-
   15.5 mu g/m(3) (mean +/- standard deviation) to 82.3 +/- 12.0 mu g/m(3)
   and 167 +/- 37.0 mu g/m(3) to 174 +/- 30.0 mu g/m(3) respectively.
   During this period, the DMA8 0 3 concentration increased by 1.9 +/- 3.3
   mu g/m(3)/yr across China, with over 70\% of the monitoring sites
   showing a positive upward trend and 19.4\% with trends >5 mu g/m(3)/yr.
   The estimated long-term all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory
   premature mortalities attributable to AVGDMA8 O-3 exposure in 350
   Chinese cities were 181,000 (95\% CI: 91,500-352,000), 112,000 (95\% CI:
   38,100-214,000) and 33,800 (95\% CI: 0-71,400) in 2019, showing
   increases of 52.5\%, 52.9\% and 54.6\% respectively compared to 2015
   levels. Similarly, short-term all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory
   premature mortalities attributed to ambient 4DMA8 O-3 exposure were
   156,000 (95\% CI: 85,300-227,000), 73,500 (95\% CI: 27,500-119,000) and
   28,600 (95\% CI: 14,500-42,800) in 2019, increases of 19.6\%, 19.8\% and
   21.2\% respectively compared to 2015. The results of this study are
   important in ascertaining the effectiveness of recent emission control
   measures and to identify the areas that require urgent attention. (C)

Title = {Mapping the cause-specific premature mortality reveals large between-
   districts disparity in Belgium, 2003-2009},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {73},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Background: Reducing premature mortality is a crucial public health
   objective. The goal of this paper, beside updating previous mortality
   atlases with recent data, is to explore the relative between-districts
   disparity using a relative-scale map design.
   Methods: Causes of deaths and population data were provided by
   Statistics Belgium. All deaths occurring in the periods 1993-1999 and
   2003-2009, in people aged 1-74 residing in Belgium were included.
   Age-adjusted rates by cause of death were computed for both periods; the
   2003-2009 rates were classified using a relative scale with a 10\%
   change between each level and represented on chloropleths maps with a
   green-to-red divergent colour scheme centred on the national mean. This
   particular design allows the comparability across all the maps since a
   same meaning is given to a specific colour. The variation coefficient
   and the decile ratio were calculated and compared between the 2 periods.
   Results: A clear-cut regional divide at the disadvantage of Wallonia,
   and to some extent, of Brussels, was seen for all-cause, cardiovascular,
   cerebrovascular, diabetes, alcohol-related, mental and neurological
   diseases and non-transport accidents premature mortality. A NE-SW
   pattern parallel to the French border was observed for Lip, Oral Cavity,
   Pharynx, Larynx and oesophageal cancers, while various patterns are
   observed for the other cancers. The highest rates of road accident
   mortality are observed in the Southern districts. Many of those patterns
   are in continuity with earlier observations. However, the pattern of
   diabetes and mental and neurological diseases are new features. The
   variation coefficient and the decile ratios increased by 10\% between
   the 1993-1997 and 2003-2009 periods.
   Conclusions: The use of a relative scale in the maps highlights the
   importance of the between-districts disparity in premature mortality,
   with for most causes, a clear-cut regional divide at the disadvantage of
   Wallonia; this health gap results of complex interactions between
   various factors, including the socioeconomic context, cultural habits
   and environmental influences, as well as public health policies. It
   should be considered as a warning signal, warranting the attention of
   the policy makers. Meanwhile, these results also highlight the potential
   for improvement in the more disadvantaged regions.},

Abstract = {Ambient air pollution ranks high among the risk factors that increase
   the global burden of disease. Previous studies focused on assessing
   mortality risk and were sparsely performed in populous developing
   countries with deteriorating environments. We conducted a time-series
   study to evaluate the air pollution-associated years of life lost (YLL)
   and mortality risk and to identify potential modifiers relating to the
   season and demographic characteristics. Using linear (for YLL) and
   Poisson (for mortality) regression models and controlling for
   time-varying factors, we found that an interquartile range (IQR)
   increase in a three-day average cumulative (lag 0-2 day) concentrations
   of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2 corresponded to increases in YLL of 12.09
   (95\% confidence interval {[}Cl]: 2.98-21.20), 13.69 (95\% CI:
   3.32-24.07), 26.95 (95\% CI: 13.99-39.91) and 24.39 (95\% CI:
   8.62-40.15) years, respectively, and to percent increases in mortality
   of 1.34\% (95\% CI: 0.67-2.01\%), 1.56\% (95\% CI: 0.80-2.33\%), 3.36\%
   (95\% CI: 2.39-4.33\%) and 2.39\% (95\% CI: 1.24-3.55\%), respectively.
   Among the specific causes of death, cardiovascular and respiratory
   diseases were positively associated with gaseous pollutants (NO2 and
   SO2). and diabetes was positively correlated with NO2 (in terms of the
   mortality risk). The effects of air pollutants were more pronounced in
   the cool season than in the warm season. The elderly (>65 years) and
   females were more vulnerable to air pollution. Studying effect estimates
   and their modifications by using YLL to detect premature death should
   support implementing health risk assessments, identifying susceptible
   groups and guiding policy-making and resource allocation according to
   specific local conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Impact of Pharmaceutical Innovation on Premature Mortality, Hospital

Abstract = {I analyse the effect that pharmaceutical innovation had on premature
   (before age 75 and 80) mortality from all diseases in Australia during
   the period 1998-2011 by investigating whether the diseases that
   experienced more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in
   premature mortality. My estimates indicate that 60 per cent of the
   1998-2011 decline in premature (before age 75) mortality was due to
   previous pharmaceutical innovation. They also indicate that previous
   pharmaceutical innovation accounted for 40 per cent of the 1986-2007
   increase (from 49.0 per cent to 61.6 per cent) in the 5-year relative
   cancer survival rate, controlling for mean age at diagnosis and the
   number of patients diagnosed, and that if no new drugs had been
   introduced during 1986-1999, the number of hospital separations in 2011
   would have been about 13 per cent higher, ceteris paribus. My estimates
   indicate that new drugs listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits
   Schemeduring 1989-2002 reduced the number of life-years lost from all
   diseases before ages 75 and 80 in 2011 by 143,639 and 257,602,
   respectively, and that the innovation was cost-saving: the reduction in
   hospital expenditure attributable to it exceeded expenditure on the
   drugs. Even if it completely ignores the apparent reduction in hospital
   expenditure, the evidence indicates that pharmaceutical innovation was
   highly cost-effective.},

Abstract = {To determine mortality trends and premature mortality due to stroke in
   Serbia in 1992-2013 period.
   We obtained mortality database from the Statistical Office of Serbia.
   From 1992 to 2005, age-standardized mortality rates (ASRs) per 100,000
   for all stroke increased, with annual percentage change (APC) of 1.01 \%
   in men and 1.05 \% in women. From 2005 to 2013, ASRs decreased, with APC
   of -4.93 \% in men, and -5.63 \% in women. In men, years of life lost
   (YLLs) for all stroke deaths were 21,710 in 1992; 22,193 in 2003 and
   17,464 in 2013, with average years of life lost (AYLLs) of 3.46, 2.89
   and 3.00, respectively. In women, YLLs were 33,508 in 1992; 35,130 in
   2003 and 21,676 in 2013, with AYLLs of 4.65; 3.57 and 2.97.
   From 1992 to 2013, ASRs and YLLs for all stroke showed two segment
   trends in Serbia, with increase in the first, and decrease in the second
   period. Due to the shorter AYLLs and longer life tables, in 2013 stroke
   deaths occurred at > 4 years older age in both sexes than in 1992.},

Title = {Deaths, disability-adjusted life years and years of life lost due to
   elevated systolic blood pressure in Poland: estimates for the Global
   Burden of Disease Study 2016},
Journal = {ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION},

Pages = {95-103},
Abstract = {Introduction. High systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a well-known risk
   factor for major adverse cardiovascular outcomes; however, data
   regarding disease burden due to high SBP in the Polish population are
   scarce.
   Material and methods. We extracted and analyzed the latest country-,
   gender-, age-and year-specific estimates from the Global Burden of
   Disease (GBD) Study 2016 for SBP-related mortality, years of life lost
   (YLLs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and attributable risk
   factors in Poland in 2016. In the GBD 2016, the term `high SBP' refers
   to SBP of at least 110-115 mmHg.
   Results. High SBP was attributable to (per 100,000) 106,043.16 deaths
   (95\% UI {[}Uncertainty Interval]: 88,207-121,849) that was 27.22\% of
   all deaths in Poland in 2016; 1,751,844.69 DALYs (95\% UI:
   1,525,188-1,966,25) and 1,497,959.71 YLLs (95\% UI:
   1,287,279-1,497,959). In males, DALYs attributable to high SBP were
   higher by 34\% and YLLs by 23\%, while in females death rates were
   higher by 14\%. SBP was highly attributable to ischemic heart disease,
   stroke, and chronic kidney disease (63.7\%, 63,1\%, and 59.1\%,
   respectively). In the GBD hierarchy, high SBP was the most common risk
   factor, followed by smoking, high body mass index (BMI), high total
   cholesterol levels, alcohol use, and high fasting plasma glucose levels.
   Conclusions. In Poland, SBP of at least 110-115 mmHg remains one of the
   largest risks for loss of good health; greater than smoking, high
   cholesterol levels, or high BMI. With the population aging globally, the
   burden due to high SBP is expected to increase further.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Traffic injuries are among the leading causes of mortality and
   morbidity worldwide. Pedestrians have been considered as a high-risk
   group among road users, especially in middle-or low-income communities.
   This study attempted to determine the burden of pedestrians' fatalities
   in Fars, the southern province of Iran using years of life lost (YLL)
   approach.
   Methods: The data used in this study were retrieved from Fars Forensic
   Medicine Organization database on pedestrian traffic accidents. The YLL
   from 2009 to 2013 was estimated using the method presented by World
   Health organization. Some epidemiological characteristics of
   pedestrians' fatalities were analyzed by SPSS.
   Results: Although YLL among 1000 male pedestrians decreased from 2.5 in
   2009 to 1.5 in 2013, it increased from 0.9 to 2.1 among 1000 females
   during the same period. Higher proportion of death was found in female,
   illiterate, and married pedestrians (p < 0.001). In addition, mortality
   was higher in pedestrians living the cities, during daytime, at home,
   and in hospitals (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Consistent with the global trends, burden of pedestrian
   accidents in Fars was also exceptionally high. Considering the national
   and cultural aspects of different countries, improving the safety of
   pedestrians demands a multi-dimensional approach with interventional
   factors concerning policies, rules, pedestrians, motor vehicles and
   environmental conditions taken into consideration. (C) 2017 Daping

Abstract = {Objectives Among older Canadians, we examined the influence of low
   social support, a weak sense of belonging, and living alone to
   understand their role on mortality risk in Canada. Methods We conducted
   a retrospective cohort study of older Canadians surveyed in 2001 from
   the Canadian Community Health Survey and followed up with death events
   through December 31, 2011 from the Canadian Vital Statistics Database.
   Analyses were stratified by age: 55-64 and 65 and older. Social support
   was assessed using measures developed for the Medical Outcomes Study. A
   sense of belonging, a binary measure, measured community integration.
   Living alone was a binary measure. Survival analysis was applied using a
   Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age, sex, income, smoking,
   and frailty. Results Among respondents 55-64 (n = 6822), low affection
   (HR = 1.37; 95\% CI 1.07, 1.75), low emotional/informational support (HR
   = 1.36; 95\% CI 1.06, 1.74), and low positive social interactions (HR =
   1.36; 95\% CI 1.06, 1.75) were associated with mortality risk. Among
   respondents 65 and older (n = 8966), low affection (HR = 1.17; 95\% CI
   1.04, 1.31), low positive social interactions (HR = 1.20; 95\% CI 1.07,
   1.34), low emotional/informational support (HR = 1.19; 95\% CI 1.06,
   1.33), and a weak sense of belonging (HR = 1.13; 95\% CI 1.05, 1.22)
   were associated with mortality risk. Conclusion Low social support and a
   weak sense of belonging are important risk factors among older Canadians
   and should be part of the dialogue in Canada about their roles in
   healthy aging.},

Title = {Maternal Obesity During Pregnancy Associates With Premature Mortality
   and Major Cardiovascular Events in Later Life},

Abstract = {One in 5 pregnant women is obese but the impact on later health is
   unknown. We aimed to determine whether maternal obesity during pregnancy
   associates with increased premature mortality and later life major
   cardiovascular events. Maternity records of women who gave birth to
   their first child between 1950 and 1976 (n=18 873) from the Aberdeen
   Maternity and Neonatal databank were linked to the National Register of
   Deaths, Scotland and Scottish Morbidity Record. The effect of maternal
   obesity at first antenatal visit on death and hospital admissions for
   cardiovascular events was tested using time-to-event analysis with Cox
   proportional hazard regression to compare outcomes of mothers in
   underweight, overweight, or obese body mass index (BMI) categories
   compared with normal BMI. Median follow-up was at 73 years. All-cause
   mortality was increased in women who were obese during pregnancy (BMI>30
   kg/m(2)) versus normal BMI after adjustment for socioeconomic status,
   smoking, gestation at BMI measurement, preeclampsia, and low birth
   weight (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.77). In
   adjusted models, overweight and obese mothers had increased risk of
   hospital admission for a cardiovascular event (1.16; 1.06-1.27 and 1.26;
   1.01-1.57) compared with normal BMI mothers. Adjustment for parity
   largely unchanged the hazard ratios (mortality: 1.43, 1.09-1.88;
   cardiovascular events overweight: 1.17, 1.07-1.29; and obese: 1.30,
   1.04-1.62). In conclusion, maternal obesity is associated with increased
   risk of premature death and cardiovascular disease. Pregnancy and early
   postpartum could represent an opportunity for interventions to identify
   obesity and reduce its adverse consequences.},

Title = {Impact of COVID-19 infection on life expectancy, premature mortality,
   and DALY in Maharashtra, India},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe COVID-19 infections and deaths have largely been uneven
   within and between countries. With 17\% of the world's population, India
   has so far had 13\% of global COVID-19 infections and 8.5\% of deaths.
   Maharashtra accounting for 9\% of India's population, is the worst
   affected state, with 19\% of infections and 33\% of total deaths in the
   country until 23rd December 2020. Though a number of studies have
   examined the vulnerability to and spread of COVID-19 and its effect on
   mortality, no attempt has been made to understand its impact on
   mortality in the states of India.MethodUsing data from multiple sources
   and under the assumption that COVID-19 deaths are additional deaths in
   the population, this paper examined the impact of the disease on
   premature mortality, loss of life expectancy, years of potential life
   lost (YPLL), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in Maharashtra.
   Descriptive statistics, a set of abridged life tables, YPLL, and DALY
   were used in the analysis. Estimates of mortality indices were compared
   pre- and during COVID-19.ResultCOVID-19 attributable deaths account for
   5.3\% of total deaths in the state and have reduced the life expectancy
   at birth by 0.8years, from 73.2years in the pre-COVID-19 period to
   72.4years by the end of 2020. If COVID-19 attributable deaths increase
   to 10\% of total deaths, life expectancy at birth will likely reduce by
   1.4years. The probability of death in 20-64years of age (the prime
   working-age group) has increased from 0.15 to 0.16 due to COVID-19.
   There has been 1.06 million additional loss of years (YPLL) in the
   state, and DALY due to COVID-19 has been estimated to be 6 per
   thousand.ConclusionCOVID-19 has increased premature mortality, YPLL, and
   DALY and has reduced life expectancy at every age in Maharashtra.},

Title = {Where psychology meets physiology: chronic stress and premature

Abstract = {A substantial and still growing body of research tries to link different
   psychological models and chronic diseases, with special emphasis on
   cardiovascular disease. These efforts have established several
   conceptual bridges that connect psychological alterations and
   psychosocial factors to the risks, onset and prognosis of cardiovascular
   disease. However, several different models have been suggested.
   Depression and learned helplessness are two central psychological models
   that have been shown to have major explanatory power in the development
   of chronic diseases. In this respect the so called Central-Eastern
   European health paradox, that is the morbidity and mortality crisis in
   these transforming societies can be regarded as a special experimental
   model.
   In this review chronic stress is proposed as an integrating theory that
   can be applied to different psychological models. Chronic stress and
   allostatic load has been shown to lead to typical pathogenetic results
   in animal experiments. Chronic stress theory is applicable to the
   explanation of the suddenly changing patterns of premature mortality
   rates in transforming societies. Literature and the different models in
   the field of psychology, behavioural sciences, and epidemiology are
   reviewed in terms of the chronic stress theory. The applicability of
   these results are investigated for further research, clinical and policy
   implications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background Evaluating premature (<65 years of age) mortality because of
   acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by demographic and regional
   characteristics may inform public health interventions. Methods and
   Results We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER
   (Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) death certificate
   database to examine premature (<65 years of age) age-adjusted AMI
   mortality rates per 100 000 and average annual percentage change from
   1999 to 2019. Overall, the age-adjusted AMI mortality rate was 13.4
   (95\% CI, 13.3-13.5). Middle-aged adults, men, non-Hispanic Black
   adults, and rural counties had higher mortality than young adults,
   women, NH White adults, and urban counties, respectively. Between 1999
   and 2019, the age-adjusted AMI mortality rate decreased at an average
   annual percentage change of -3.4 per year (95\% CI, -3.6 to -3.3), with
   the average annual percentage change showing higher decline in
   age-adjusted AMI mortality rates among large (-4.2 per year {[}95\% CI,
   -4.4 to -4.0]), and medium/small metros (-3.3 per year {[}95\% CI, -3.5
   to -3.1]) than rural counties (-2.4 per year {[}95\% CI, -2.8 to -1.9]).
   Age-adjusted AMI mortality rates >90th percentile were distributed in
   the Southern states, and those with mortality <10th percentile were
   clustered in the Western and Northeastern states. After an initial
   decline between 1999 and 2011 (-4.3 per year {[}95\% CI, -4.6 to -4.1]),
   the average annual percentage change showed deceleration in mortality
   since 2011 (-2.1 per year {[}95\% CI, -2.4 to -1.8]). These trends were
   consistent across both sexes, all ethnicities and races, and urban/rural
   counties. Conclusions During the past 20 years, decline in premature AMI
   mortality has slowed down in the United States since 2011, with
   considerable heterogeneity across demographic groups, states, and
   urbanicity. Systemic efforts are mandated to address cardiovascular
   health disparities and outcomes among nonelderly adults.},

Abstract = {Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are associated with an increase
   in risk for mortality for people with an FASD and their siblings. In
   this study we examine mortality rates of birth mothers of children with
   FASD, using a retrospective case control methodology. We utilized the
   North Dakota FASD Registry to locate birth certificates for children
   with FASD which we used to identify birth mothers. We then searched for
   mothers' death certificates. We then compared the mortality rates of the
   birth mothers with an age matched control group comprised of all North
   Dakota women who were born and died in the same year as the birth
   mother. The birth mothers of children with FASD had a mortality rate of
   15/304 = 4.93\%; (95\% CI 2.44-7.43\%). The mortality rate for control
   mothers born in same years as the FASD mothers was 126/114,714 = 0.11\%
   (95\% CI 0.09-0.13\%). Mothers of children with an FASD had a 44.82 fold
   increase in mortality risk and 87\% of the deaths occurred in women
   under the age of 50. Three causes of death (cancer, injuries, and
   alcohol related disease) accounted for 67\% of the deaths in the mothers
   of children with FASD. A diagnosis of FASD is an important risk marker
   for premature death in the mothers of children diagnosed with an FASD.
   These women should be encouraged to enter substance abuse treatment.},

Title = {Premature Mortality Associated with Exposure to Outdoor Black Carbon and
   Its Source Contributions in China},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {170},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Epidemiological studies have shown that outdoor black carbon (BC) has
   higher health risks than other constituents and the total fine
   particulate matter (PM2.5). In this study, we estimated premature
   mortality attributed to BC in China in 2013 using a health impact model
   combined with annual average BC concentrations predicted using the
   Community Multi-scale Air Quality model. Source contributions to BC from
   six different source sectors were estimated using the source-oriented
   method, including residential, industrial, transportation, open burning,
   power, and other sources. The sensitivity of BC-related premature
   mortality to emission reductions in different sources was quantified in
   different regions of China. The results showed that the total all-cause
   premature mortality related to BC was approximately 1,436,957 (95\% CI:
   998,746-2,029,210) in China in 2013. Residential, industrial, and
   transportations sources were the three main sources of BC-induced
   premature mortality. Central China, Yangtze River Delta, and Sichuan
   Basin had the highest BC-induced mortality due to a high level of
   emissions and a dense population. A sensitivity test by assuming the
   same exposure-response coefficient of BC as the total PM2.5 showed the
   number of deaths was 265,122 thousand (95\% CI: 541,90, 445,943) which
   can be treated as the lower limit of the BC-related mortality in China.
   Despite the uncertainties in estimates, it is suggested that reducing BC
   emissions in China would lead to significant health benefits.
   Controlling BC from industrial and transportation sources would bring
   more relative mortality reductions, from a percentage point of view, in
   most provinces of China.},

Title = {Decomposition of the US black/white inequality in premature mortality,
   2010-2015: an observational study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Objective Decompose the US black/white inequality in premature mortality
   into shared and group-specific risks to better inform health policy.
   Setting All 50 US states and the District of Columbia, 2010 to 2015.
   Participants A total of 2.85 million non-Hispanic white and 762639
   non-Hispanic black US-resident decedents.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures The race-specific county-level
   relative risks for US blacks and whites, separately, and the risk ratio
   between groups.
   Results There is substantial geographic variation in premature mortality
   for both groups and the risk ratio between groups. After adjusting for
   median household income, county-level relative risks ranged from 0.46 to
   2.04 (median: 1.03) for whites and from 0.31 to 3.28 (median: 1.15) for
   blacks. County-level risk ratios (black/white) ranged from 0.33 to 4.56
   (median: 1.09). Half of the geographic variation in white premature
   mortality was shared with blacks, while only 15\% of the geographic
   variation in black premature mortality was shared with whites.
   Non-Hispanic blacks experience substantial geographic variation in
   premature mortality that is not shared with whites. Moreover,
   black-specific geographic variation was not accounted for by median
   household income.
   Conclusion Understanding geographic variation in mortality is crucial to
   informing health policy; however, estimating mortality is difficult at
   small spatial scales or for small subpopulations. Bayesian joint spatial
   models ameliorate many of these issues and can provide a nuanced
   decomposition of risk. Using premature mortality as an example
   application, we show that Bayesian joint spatial models are a powerful
   tool as researchers grapple with disentangling neighbourhood contextual
   effects and sociodemographic compositional effects of an area when
   evaluating health outcomes. Further research is necessary in fully
   understanding when and how these models can be applied in an
   epidemiological setting.},

   illness (SMI) are usually based in one setting, hospital (secondary care
   inpatients and/or outpatients) or community (primary care). This may
   lead to ascertainment bias. This study aimed to estimate standardised
   mortality ratios (SMRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in
   people with SMI drawn from linked primary and secondary care populations
   compared to the general population. SMRs were calculated using the
   indirect method for a United Kingdom population of almost four million
   between 2004 and 2013. The all-cause SMR was higher in the cohort
   identified from secondary care hospital admissions (SMR: 2.9; 95\% CI:
   2.8-3.0) than from primary care (SMR: 2.2; 95\% CI: 2.1-2.3) when
   compared to the general population. The SMR for the combined cohort was
   2.6 (95\% CI: 2.5-2.6). Cause specific SMRs in the combined cohort were
   particularly elevated in those with SMI relative to the general
   population for ill-defined and unknown causes, suicide, substance abuse,
   Parkinson's disease, accidents, dementia, infections and respiratory
   disorders (particularly pneumonia), and Alzheimer's disease. Solely
   hospital admission based studies, which have dominated the literature
   hitherto, somewhat over-estimate premature mortality in those with SMI.
   People with SMI are more likely to die by ill-defined and unknown
   causes, suicide and other less common and often under-reported causes.
   Comprehensive characterisation of mortality is important to inform
   policy and practice and to discriminate settings to allow for
   proportionate interventions to address this health injustice. (c) 2018

Abstract = {When someone dies prematurely from cancer this represents a loss of
   productivity for society. This loss can be valued and provides a measure
   of the cancer burden. We estimated paid and unpaid productivity lost due
   to cancer-related premature mortality in 31 European countries in 2018.
   Lost productivity was estimated for all cancers combined and 23 cancer
   sites, overall, by region and country. Deaths aged 15 to 64 were
   abstracted from GLOBOCAN 2018. Unpaid time lost (housework, caring,
   volunteering) was derived from Eurostat. Paid and unpaid productivity
   losses were valued using the human capital approach. In total, 347,149
   premature cancer deaths occurred (60\% male). The total value of
   cancer-related lost productivity was euro104.6 billion. Of this,
   euro52.9 billion (50.6\%) was due to lost paid work, and euro51.7
   billion (49.4\%) to unpaid work. Females accounted for 36.7\% of paid
   work costs but half (51.1\%) of the unpaid work costs. Costs were
   highest in Western Europe (euro52.0 billion). The most costly cancer was
   lung (euro21.7 billion), followed by breast (euro10.6 billion). The
   average loss per premature death was highest for Hodgkin's lymphoma
   (euro506 345), melanoma (euro450 694), brain cancer (euro428 449) and
   leukaemia (euro378 750). Cancer-related lost productivity costs are
   significant. Almost half are due to unpaid work losses, indicating the
   importance of considering both paid and unpaid labour in assessing the
   cancer economic burden. The high cost per premature death of some less
   common cancers illustrates the potential benefits that could accrue from
   investment in prevention and control of these cancers.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Air quality across the northern hemisphere over the past two
   decades has witnessed dramatic changes, with continuous improvement in
   developed countries in North America and Europe, but a contrasting sharp
   deterioration in developing regions of Asia.
   OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the historical trend in the long-term
   exposure to PM2.5 and PM2.5-related premature mortality
   (PM2.5-mortality) and its response to changes in emission that occurred
   during 1990-2010 across the northern hemisphere. Implications for future
   trends in human exposure to air pollution in both developed and
   developing regions of the world are discussed.
   METHODS: We employed the integrated exposure-response model developed by
   Health Effects Institute to estimate the PM2.5-mortality. The 1990-2010
   annual average PM2.5 concentrations were obtained from the simulations
   using the WRF-CMAQ model. Emission mitigation efficiencies of sulfur
   dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and primary PM are
   estimated from the PM2.5-mortality responses to the emission variations.
   RESULTS: Estimated PM2.5-mortalities in East Asia and South Asia
   increased by 21\% and 85\% respectively, from 866,000 and 578,000 in
   1990, to 1,048,000 and 1,068,000 in 2010. PM2.5-mortalities in developed
   regions (i.e., Europe and high-income North America) decreased
   substantially by 67\% and 58\% respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Over the past two decades, correlations between population
   and PM2.5 have become weaker in Europe and North America due to air
   pollution controls but stronger in East Asia due to deteriorating air
   quality. Mitigation of primary PM appears to be the most efficient way
   for increasing health benefits (i.e., providing the largest mortality
   reduction per unit emissions). However, reductions in emissions of NH3

Title = {Educational inequalities in premature mortality in Poland, 2002-2011: a
   population-based cross-sectional study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9},
Abstract = {Background: The aim of the study is to evaluate the differences in
   premature mortality between educational groups of Polish inhabitants in
   2002 and 2011.
   Methods: The analysis included all deaths among inhabitants of Poland,
   aged 25-64 years, which occurred in 2002 (N=97 004) and 2011 (N=104
   598). We calculated age-standardised death rates (SDRs) and summary
   measures on inequalities. The relative index of inequality (RII) was
   calculated with Poisson regression.
   Results: The SDR for Poland decreased from 285.7 per 100 000 in 2002 to
   246.0 in 2011 among males with higher education and increased from
   1141.0 in 2002 to 1183.0 in 2011 among males with lower secondary or
   less education (the rate ratio increased from 4.0 to 4.8). With regard
   to females with higher education, the SDR decreased from 127.2 per 100
   000 in 2002 to 115.6 in 2011. Among females with lower secondary or less
   education, the SDR increased from 375.8 per 100 000 in 2002 to 423.1 in
   2011 (the rate ratio increased from 3.0 to 3.7). The RII increased from
   5.8 to 9.7 in the male group and from 4.4 to 8.3 in the female group.
   The greatest educational inequalities in 2011 were observed in females
   who died of cardiovascular diseases (RII=14.9) and lung cancer (RII=6.6)
   and in males who died of suicides (RII=19.3) and lung cancer (RII=11.9).
   Conclusions: Educational inequalities in premature mortality in Poland
   are growing. There is a need to implement health education programmes
   targeted at groups of the most poorly educated Polish inhabitants,
   especially for diseases resulting from smoking and excessive alcohol
   consumption.},

Title = {Premature Mortality Due to PM2.5 Over India: Effect of Atmospheric
   Transport and Anthropogenic Emissions},
Journal = {GEOHEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-10},

Abstract = {The annual premature mortality in India attributed to exposure to
   ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) exceeds 1 million (Cohen et al.,
   2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30505-6). Studies have
   estimated sector-specific premature mortality from ambient PM2.5
   exposure in India and shown residential energy use is the dominant
   contributing sector. In this study, we estimate the contribution of
   PM2.5 and premature mortality from six regions of India in 2012 using
   the global chemical-transport model. We calculate how premature
   mortality in India is determined by the transport of pollution from
   different regions. Of the estimated 1.1 million annual premature deaths
   from PM2.5 in India, about similar to 60\% was from anthropogenic
   pollutants emitted from within the region in which premature mortality
   occurred, similar to 19\% was from transport of anthropogenic pollutants
   between different regions within India, similar to 16\% was due to
   anthropogenic pollutants emitted outside of India, and similar to 4\%
   was associated with natural PM2.5 sources. The emissions from Indo
   Gangetic Plain contributed to similar to 46\% of total premature
   mortality over India, followed by Southern India (13\%). Indo Gangetic
   Plain also contributed (similar to 8\%) to the most premature
   mortalities in other regions of India through transport. More than 50\%
   of the premature mortality in Northern, Eastern, Western, and Central
   India was due to transport of PM2.5 from regions outside of these
   individual regions. Our results indicate that reduction in anthropogenic
   emissions over India, as well as its neighboring regions, will be
   required to reduce the health impact of ambient PM2.5 in India.},

Title = {An examination of the association between premature mortality and life

Abstract = {Background: A feature of the health of men across Europe is their higher
   rates of premature mortality and shorter life expectancy at birth than
   women. Following the publication of the first State of Men's Health in
   Europe report, we sought to explore possible reasons. Method: We
   analyzed trends in life expectancy at birth in 19 European Union member
   states (EU19) between 1999 and 2008 using mortality data obtained from
   Eurostat. We then used Pollard's decomposition method to identify the
   contribution of deaths from different causes and at different age groups
   to differences in life expectancy. Results: Between 1999 and 2008, life
   expectancy at birth in the EU19 increased by 2.74 years for men and by
   2.09 years for women. Most of these improvements were due to reductions
   in mortality at ages > 60, with cardiovascular disease accounting for
   approximately half these improvements for men. In 2008, life expectancy
   of men in the EU19 was 5.92 years lower than that of women. Deaths from
   all major groups of causes, and at all ages, contributed to this gap,
   with external causes contributing 0.96 years, cardiovascular disease
   1.80 years and neoplasms 1.61 years. Conclusion: Improvements in the
   life expectancy at birth of men and women have mostly occurred at older
   ages. There has been little improvement in the high rate of premature
   death in younger men, suggesting a need for interventions to tackle
   their high death rate.},

Abstract = {The rationale of this study is the need for economic development of
   Russia's regions in the conditions of the current economic slowdown
   caused by external and internal factors. This paper explores changes in
   regional priorities of reduction of premature mortality in the economic
   conditions of a growing focus on public health and living standards. The
   transformation should entail better management decisions and more
   efficient use of resources, especially the financial resources. The
   purpose of the study was to determine the current priorities of reducing
   premature mortality given the economic situation in the region (through
   the example of the Perm region).},

Title = {Premature mortality due to stomach cancer in Japan: a nationwide

Abstract = {Purpose: Premature mortality offers an alternative approach for
   monitoring the burden of mortality; however, little is known about its
   measures for stomach cancer. In the present study, we investigated
   temporal changes in premature mortality because of stomach cancer in the
   Japanese population from 1980 to 2015.
   Methods: Mortality data for stomach cancer were obtained from the World
   Health Organization mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was
   calculated using Japanese life tables. The average lifespan shortened
   was calculated and defined as the ratio of YLL in relation to the
   expected lifespan.
   Results: Over a 35-year time frame, the age-standardized rates adjusted
   to the World Standard Population for deaths from stomach cancer
   substantially decreased in both sexes. The results from the average YLL
   (AYLL) measure showed that lifespan of stomach cancer patients was
   prolonged by about 3 and 5 years in men and women, respectively. The
   average lifespan shortened measure showed that stomach cancer led to a
   loss of 18.5\% of lifespan among men and of 21.9\% among women in 1980,
   but these numbers were reduced to 13.6\% and 14.5\%, respectively, in
   2015.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated decreasing trends in premature
   mortality for stomach cancer in Japan over a 35-year period. (C) 2020

Title = {Differences in education and premature mortality: a record linkage study
   of over 35 million Italians},

Abstract = {Background: Large, representative studies are needed to evaluate
   cause-specific aspects of socio-economic inequalities in mortality.
   Methods: We conducted a census-based retrospective cohort study to
   quantify differences in cause-specific premature mortality by
   educational level in Italy. We linked the 2011 Italian census with 2012
   and 2013 death registries. We used the mortality rate ratio (MRR) as a
   measure of relative inequality. Results: Overall, 305 043 deaths (190
   061 men-114982 women) were registered from a population of 35 708 445
   subjects aged 30-74. The age-standardized mortality rate for all
   educational levels was 57.68 deaths per 10 000 personyears among men and
   31.41 among women. MRR from all causes was 0.51 (95\% CI: 0.49; 0.52) in
   men and 0.63 (95\% CI: 0.61; 0.65) in women for the highest (university)
   compared to the lowest level of education (none or primary school). The
   association was stronger in single than in married individuals: MRRs
   were 0.36 (95\% CI: 0.34; 0.39) in single men, 0.57 (95\% CI: 0.55;
   0.59) in married men, 0.44 (95\% CI: 0.40; 0.47) in single women and
   0.69 (95\% CI: 0.66; 0.72) in married women. High education was
   associated with lower mortality from liver, circulatory, chronic
   respiratory and genitourinary diseases in both sexes. Highly educated
   men had a lower mortality from lung cancer than less educated men,
   whereas highly educated women did not have a reduced mortality from lung
   and breast cancers. Conclusion: Level of education is a strong indicator
   of premature mortality. The magnitude of the association between
   educational level and mortality differs across sexes, marital status and
   causes of death.},

Title = {Association of spontaneous abortion with all cause and cause specific
   premature mortality: prospective cohort study},
Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {372},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE
   To investigate the association of spontaneous abortion with the risk of
   all cause and cause specific premature mortality (death before the age
   of 70).
   DESIGN
   Prospective cohort study.
   SETTING
   The Nurses' Health Study II (1993-2017), United States.
   PARTICIPANTS
   101 681 ever gravid female nurses participating in the Nurses' Health
   Study II.
   MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES
   Lifetime occurrence of spontaneous abortion in pregnancies lasting less
   than 6 months, determined by biennial questionnaires. Hazard ratios and
   95\% confidence intervals for all cause and cause specific premature
   death according to the occurrence of spontaneous abortion, estimated
   with time dependent Cox proportional hazards models.
   RESULTS
   During 24 years of follow-up, 2936 premature deaths were recorded,
   including 1346 deaths from cancer and 269 from cardiovascular disease.
   Crude all cause mortality rates were comparable for women with and
   without a history of spontaneous abortion (1.24 per 1000 person years in
   both groups) but were higher for women experiencing three or more
   spontaneous abortions (1.47 per 1000 person years) and for women
   reporting their first spontaneous abortion before the age of 24 (1.69
   per 1000 person years). The corresponding age adjusted hazard ratios for
   all cause premature death during follow-up were 1.02 (95\% confidence
   interval 0.94 to 1.11), 1.39 (1.03 to 1.86), and 1.27 (1.11 to 1.46),
   respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors and updated
   dietary and lifestyle factors, the occurrence of spontaneous abortion
   was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.19 (95\% confidence interval
   1.08 to 1.30) for premature mortality during follow-up. The association
   was stronger for recurrent spontaneous abortions (hazard ratio 1.59,
   95\% confidence interval 1.17 to 2.15 for three or more spontaneous
   abortions; 1.23, 1.00 to 1.50 for two; and 1.16, 1.05 to 1.28 for one
   compared with none), and for spontaneous abortions occurring early in a
   woman's reproductive life (1.32, 1.14 to 1.53 for age <= 23; 1.16, 1.01
   to 1.33 for ages 24-29; and 1.12, 0.98 to 1.28 for age >= 30 compared
   with none). When cause specific mortality was evaluated, the association
   of spontaneous abortion with premature death was strongest for deaths
   from cardiovascular disease (1.48, 1.09 to 1.99). Spontaneous abortion
   was not related to premature death from cancer (1.08, 0.94 to 1.24).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Spontaneous abortion was associated with an increased risk of premature
   mortality, particularly death from cardiovascular disease.},

Abstract = {We study the relation between per capita income and mortality within six
   countries of the European Union - Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium,
   France, Italy and Spain - in 1981-1985 and 1996-2000. We obtained
   information on gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) and mortality
   in large residential areas. The areas in each country were grouped in
   quintiles as a function of GDPpc. In 1996-2000, a negative gradient was
   seen in premature mortality front all causes in men and women in
   accordance with the GDPpc quintile, except in the Netherlands and in
   women in Finland. In Belgium, France, Italy and Spain, the impact of
   GDPpe on premature mortality was stronger in 1996-2000 than in
   1981-1985. All six countries showed a negative gradient in premature
   mortality from cardiovascular disease by GDPpc. The pathways by which
   residential area with lower wealth is associated with higher mortality
   are probably related with investment in economic and social resources
   over time, although for some causes of death, this association is not
   seen in some countries due to specific historic and cultural
   circumstances. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the link between the ambient level of particulate
   pollution and subsequent human health effects and various sources of
   uncertainty when total exposure is taken into consideration. The
   exposure simulation model statistically simulates daily personal total
   exposure to ambient PM and nonambient PM generated from indoor sources.
   It incorporates outdoor-indoor penetration of PM, contributions of PM
   from indoor sources, and time-activity patterns for target groups of the
   population. The model is illustrated for Los Angeles County using recent
   1997 monitoring data for both PM10 and PM2.5. The results indicate that,
   on average, outdoor-source PM contributes about 20-25\% of the total PM
   exposure to Los Angeles County individuals not exposed to environmental
   tobacco smoking (ETS), and about 15\% for those who are exposed to ETS.
   The model computes both the fractional contribution of outdoor
   concentrations to total exposure and the effect of exposure
   uncertainties on the estimated slope of the (linear)
   concentration-response curve in time-series studies for PM health
   effects. The. latter considers the effects of measurement and
   misclassification error on PM epidemiological time-series studies. The
   paper compares the predictions of a conventional PM epidemiological
   model, based solely on ambient concentration measurements at a central
   monitoring station, and an exposure simulation model, which considers
   the quantitative relationship between central - monitoring PM
   concentrations and total individual exposures to particulate matter. The
   results show that the effects of adjusting from outdoor concentrations
   to personal exposures and correcting dose-response bias are nearly
   equal, so that roughly the same premature mortalities associated with
   short-term exposure to both ambient PM2.5 and PM10 in Los Angeles County
   are predicted with both models. The uncertainty in the slope of the
   concentration-response curve in the time - series studies is the single
   most important source of uncertainty in both the ambient - and the
   exposure-health model.},

Title = {Mild pulmonary hypertension and premature mortality among 154 956 men
   and women undergoing routine echocardiography},

Abstract = {Background Although mild pulmonary hypertension is known to be
   associated with increased mortality, its impact on premature mortality
   is largely unknown.
   Methods We studied the distribution of estimated right ventricular
   systolic pressure (eRVSP) among a total of 154956 adults with no
   evidence of left heart disease investigated with echocardiography. We
   then examined individually linked mortality, premature mortality and
   associated life-years lost (LYL) according to eRVSP levels.
   Results The cohort comprised 70 826 men and 84130 women (aged 61.3 +/-
   17.7 and 61.4 +/- 18.4 years, respectively). Overall, 85 173 (55.0\%),
   49 276 (31.8\%), 13 060 (8.4\%) and 7447 (4.8\%) cases had eRVSP levels
   indicative of no (<30.0 mmHg), mild (30.0-39.9 mmHg), moderate
   (40.0-49.9 mmHg) or severe (>= 50.0 mmHg) pulmonary hypertension,
   respectively. During a median (interquartile range) 5.7 (3.2-8.9) years
   of follow-up, 38 456/154986 (24.8\%) individuals died. Compared with
   eRVSP <30.0 mmHg, age and sex-adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause and
   cardiovascular-related mortality were 1.90 (95\% CI 1.84-1.96) and 1.85
   (95\% CI 1.74-1.97), respectively, for eRVSP 35.0-39.9 mmHg. Overall,
   6256 (54\%) men and 7524 (55\%) women died prematurely. As a proportion
   of all deaths, premature mortality rose from 46.7\% to 79.2\% among
   those with eRVSP <30.0 versus >= 60.0 mmHg with a mean of 5.1-11.4 LYL
   each time. However, due to more individuals affected overall, eRVSP
   30.0-39.9 mmHg accounted for 58\% and 53\% of total LYL among men (40
   606/70 019 LYL) and women (47 333/88 568 LYL), respectively.
   Conclusions These data confirm that elevated eRVSP levels indicative of
   mild pulmonary hypertension are associated with increased risk of death.
   Moreover, this results in a substantive component of premature
   mortality/LYL that requires more proactive clinical surveillance and
   management.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the association between ( 1) local political
   party, ( 2) urban policies, measured by spending on local programmes,
   and ( 3) income inequality with premature mortality in large US cities.
   Design: Cross sectional ecological study.
   Outcome measures: All cause death rates and death rates attributable to
   preventable or immediate causes for people under age 75.
   Predictor measures: Income inequality, city spending, and social
   factors.
   Setting: All central cities in the US with population equal to or
   greater than 100 000.
   Results: Income inequality is the most significant social variable
   associated with preventable or immediate death rates, and the relation
   is very strong: a unit increase in the Gini coefficient is associated
   with 37\% higher death rates. Spending on police is associated with 23\%
   higher preventable death rates compared with 14\% lower death rates in
   cities with high spending on roads.
   Conclusions: Cities with high income inequality and poverty are so far
   unable to reduce their mortality through local expenditures on public
   goods, regardless of the mayoral party. Longitudinal data are necessary
   to determine if city spending on social programmes reduces mortality
   over time.},

Abstract = {AimsTo investigate risk factors for, and the influence of premature
   mortality on, dementia complicating type 2 diabetes.MethodsParticipants
   with type 2 diabetes in the community-based observational Fremantle
   Diabetes Study Phase 1 (n=1291, mean age 64.0years) were followed from
   1993 to 1996 to end-June 2012. Incident dementia was identified from
   validated health databases. Dementia risk was assessed using Cox
   proportional hazards modelling supplemented by competing risk regression
   modelling in the total cohort and sub-groups defined by age of diabetes
   onset as mid-life (<65years) or late-life (65years).ResultsDuring meanSD
   follow-up of 12.7 +/- 5.9 years, 717 participants (55.5\%) died and 180
   (13.9\%) developed dementia. Overall, few risk factors predicted
   incident dementia and most predicted time to death. In mid-life
   diabetes, incident dementia was predicted by diabetes duration,
   cerebrovascular disease, schizophrenia, antipsychotic medication and the
   APOE epsilon 4 allele. In late-life diabetes, risk factors were
   peripheral neuropathy, lack of exercise, lower fasting serum glucose, no
   antihypertensive therapy and the APOE epsilon 4 allele. Competing risk
   analysis showed age to be a positive predictor compared with the inverse
   association in Cox models that suggested survivor bias in an older
   community-based cohort.ConclusionsDementia in type 2 diabetes is
   multifactorial. An association with diabetes duration, independent of
   most possible confounders, suggests that one or more unmeasured
   processes specific to diabetes may be implicated in the pathogenesis.
   The risk factors for dementia were also associated with an increased
   risk of death. This suggests that recently reported improvements in
   mortality in type 2 diabetes may be accompanied by reductions in
   dementia incidence.},

Abstract = {The available large prospective studies supporting an inverse
   association between better adherence to the Mediterranean diet and lower
   mortality have mainly included older adults. It is not clear whether
   this inverse association is also present among younger individuals at
   lower mortality risk. Our aim was to assess the association between
   adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total mortality in middle-aged
   adults from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project. We
   followed 15,535 Spanish university graduates for a mean of 6.8 y. Their
   mean age was 38 +/- 12 y, 59.6\% were females, and all were initially
   free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. A validated FFQ
   was used to assess dietary habits. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet
   was categorized, into 3 groups according to the Mediterranean Diet Score
   (low, 0-2 points; moderate, 3-5 points; and high, 6-9 points). The
   outcome variable was total mortality. Cox proportional hazards models
   were used to estimate HR and 95\% CI. We adjusted the estimates for sex,
   age, years of university education, BMI, smoking, physical activity,
   television watching, history of depression and baseline hypertension,
   and hypercholesterolemia. We observed 125 deaths during 105,980
   person-years of follow-up. The fully adjusted HR for moderate and high
   adherence were 0.58(95\% CI: 0.34, 0.99; P = 0.05) and 0.38 (95\% CI:
   0.21, 0.70; P = 0.002), respectively. For each 2-point increment in the
   Mediterranean Diet Score, the HR of death was 0.72 (95\% CI: 0.58, 0.91;
   P = 0.006). Among highly educated, middle-aged adults, adherence to the
   traditional Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced risk of
   death. J. Nutr. 142: 1672-1678, 2012.},

Title = {Gender Patterns of Socioeconomic Differences in Premature Mortality:
   Follow-up of the Hungarian Epidemiological Panel},

Abstract = {Background Gender differences in premature mortality rates and in the
   size of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality vary across countries.
   Purpose We aimed to quantify the gender differences in the association
   between socioeconomic status (SES) and premature all-cause mortality and
   to analyse whether psychosocial factors might associate between SES and
   mortality among men and women separately in the middle-aged Hungarian
   population.
   Method Men (n=1130) and women (n=1529), aged 4069 years, participants in
   the Hungarian Epidemiological Panel (2002) were followed up for 3.5
   years for total mortality. Cox proportional hazard models were used to
   evaluate the association between several socioeconomic measures and
   total death.
   Results During the follow-up, 99 men (8.8\%) and 53 women (3.5\%) died.
   The age-adjusted hazard ratios and the Rothman's synergy indexes showed
   that each measure of socioeconomic position was more deleterious in men
   compared with women. When investigating potential explanatory factors
   for the SES-mortality association, we found that adjustment for severe
   depression resulted in the most pronounced reduction in the regression
   coefficients for the association between most socioeconomic factors and
   male premature death. There was no indication that depression would
   mediate between SES and mortality in women. Work stress factors, poor
   lifestyle and low social support also contributed to the explanation of
   the link between socioeconomic disadvantage and premature death in men.
   Conclusion Middle-aged Hungarian men seem to be considerably more
   vulnerable to the chronic stress of material disadvantage than women.
   This effect modification by gender might partly be explained by a
   stronger connection between low SES and depressive symptoms in men.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cynical distrust on
   mortality in middle-aged and aging men. The analysis is based on Kuopio
   Ischemic Heart Disease study, follow-up from 1984 to 2011. Sample
   consisted of 2682 men, aged 42-61 years at baseline. Data on mortality
   was provided by the National Death Registry, causes of death were
   classified by the National Center of Statistics of Finland. Cynical
   distrust was measured at baseline using Cynical Distrust Scale. Survival
   analyses were conducted using Cox regression models. In crude estimates
   after 28 years of follow-up, high cynical distrust was associated with
   1.5-1.7 higher hazards for earlier death compared to low cynical
   distrust. Adjusted for conventional risk factors, high cynical distrust
   was significantly associated regarding CVD-free men and CVD mortality,
   while non-CVD mortality in study sample was consistently but not
   significantly associated. The risk effects were more expressed after
   12-20 years rather than in earlier or later follow-up. To conclude, high
   cynical distrust associates with increased risk of CVD mortality in
   CVD-free men. The associations with non-CVD mortality are weaker and not
   reach statistical significance.},

Abstract = {The problem of increasing mortality from noncommunicable disease (NCD)
   in the Philippines warrants an in-depth assessment of the potential
   impact of NCD interventions by the national government. This research
   aims to compare trends before and after a critical milestone in the
   prevention and control of these lifestyle-related diseases, the release
   of the manual of operations on Prevention and Control of Chronic
   Lifestyle-Related Noncommunicable Diseases in the Philippines in 2010.
   Interrupted time series analysis with segmented regression was performed
   on secondary ecologic data extracted from the national mortality
   database maintained by the Philippine Statistics Authority-National
   Statistics Office. The prevention of deaths among 30-69 year-old adults
   secondary to the intervention was notable only for cardiovascular
   diseases. The intervention had minimal effect in deterring premature
   mortality from cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes
   mellitus. This application of interrupted time series analysis with
   segmented regression provides pragmatic evidence as to the impact of one
   of the landmark national strategies on NCD prevention and control.},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Patients with epilepsy are at an elevated risk of premature
   mortality. Interventions to reduce this risk are crucial.
   OBJECTIVE To determine if the level of care (non-neurologist,
   neurologist, or comprehensive epilepsy program) is negatively associated
   with the risk of premature mortality.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective open cohort
   study, all adult patients 18 years or older who met the administrative
   case definition for incident epilepsy in linked databases (Alberta
   Health Services administrative health data and the Comprehensive Calgary
   Epilepsy Programme Registry {[}CEP]) inclusive of the years 2002 to 2016
   were followed up until death or loss to follow-up. The final analyses
   were performed on May 1, 2019.
   EXPOSURES Evaluation by a non-neurologist, neurologist, or
   epileptologist.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome was all-cause mortality. We used
   extended Cox models treating exposure to a neurologist or the CEP as
   time-varying covariates. Age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, disease
   severity, and comorbid burden at index date were modeled as fixed-time
   coefficients.
   RESULTS A total 23653 incident cases were identified (annual incidence
   of 89 per 100000); the mean age (SD) at index date was 50.8 (19.1) years
   and 12158 (50.3\%) were women. A total of 14099 (60\%) were not exposed
   to specialist neurological care, 9554 (40\%) received care by a
   neurologist, and 2054 (9\%) received care in the CEP. In total, 4098
   deaths (71\%) occurred in the nonspecialist setting, 1481 (26\%) for
   those seen by a neurologist, and 176 (3\%) for those receiving CEP care.
   The standardized mortality rate was 7.2\% for the entire cohort, 9.4\%
   for those receiving nonspecialist care, 5.6\% for those seen by a
   neurologist, and 2.8\% for those seen in the CEP. The hazard ratio (HR)
   of mortality was lower in those receiving neurologist (HR, 0.85; 95\%
   CI, 0.77-0.93) and CEP (HR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.62) care. In
   multivariable modeling, specialist care, the age at index, and disease
   severity were retained in the final model of the association between
   specialist care and mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exposure to specialist care is associated with
   incremental reductions in the hazard of premature mortality. Those
   referred to a comprehensive epilepsy program received the greatest
   benefit.},

Abstract = {Objective. Patients with SLE have increased morbidity and premature
   mortality. Whether this mortality gap has improved in recent years, as
   in RA, is unknown.
   Methods. We conducted a population-based cohort study using a medical
   records database representative of the general population of the UK. We
   identified incident SLE cases and matched non-SLE controls between 1999
   and 2014, divided into two subgroups based on year of SLE diagnosis,
   forming the early cohort (1999-2006) and late cohort (2007-14). We
   compared the mortality rates and hazard ratios, adjusting for potential
   confounders.
   Results. We identified 1470 and 1666 incident SLE cases in the early and
   late cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, SLE patients had similar
   levels of excess mortality compared with their matched comparators
   {[}15.9 vs 7.9 deaths/1000 person-years (PY) in the early cohort and
   13.8 vs 7.0 deaths/1000 PY in the late cohort]. The corresponding
   mortality hazard ratios were 2.15 (95\% CI 1.63, 2.83) and 2.12 (95\% CI
   1.61, 2.80) in the early and late cohorts, respectively (P-value for
   interaction = 0.95). The absolute mortality differences were 8.0 (95\%
   CI 4.3, 11.8) and 6.8 (95\% CI 3.5, 10.0) deaths/1000 PY, respectively
   (P-value for interaction = 0.61).
   Conclusion. This general population-based cohort study suggests that
   excess mortality has not improved among SLE patients in recent years,
   remaining greater than double that of comparators, unlike RA during the
   same period. This highlights a critical unmet need for the development
   of new therapeutic agents and improved management strategies for SLE and
   its comorbidities.},

Title = {Estimating multiple greenspace exposure types and their associations
   with neighbourhood premature mortality: A socioecological study},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {789},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Background: Greenspace exposures are often measured using single
   exposure metrics, which can lead to conflicting results. Existing
   methodologies are limited in their ability to estimate greenspace
   exposure comprehensively. We demonstrate new methods for estimating
   single and combined greenspace exposure metrics, representing multiple
   exposure types that combine impacts at various scales. We also
   investigate the association between those greenspace exposure types and
   premature mortality. Methods: We used geospatial data and spatial
   analytics to model and map greenspace availability, accessibility and
   eye-level visibility exposure metrics. These were harmonised and
   standardised to create a novel composite greenspace exposure index
   (CGEI). Using these metrics, we investigated associations between
   greenspace exposures and years of potential life lost (YPLL) for 1673
   neighbourhoods applying spatial autoregressive models. We also
   investigated the variations in these associations in conjunction with
   levels of socioeconomic deprivation based on the index of multiple
   deprivations. Results: Our new CGEI metric provides the opportunity to
   estimate spatially explicit total greenspace exposure. We found that a
   1-unit increase in neighbourhood CGEI was associated with approximately
   a 10-year reduction in YPLL. Meaning a 0.1 increment or 10\% increase in
   the CGEI is associated with an approximately one year lower premature
   mortality value. A single 1-unit increase in greenspace availability was
   associated with a YPLL reduction of 9.8 years, whereas greenness
   visibility related to a reduction of 6.14 years. We found no significant
   association between greenspace accessibility and YPLL. Our results
   further identified divergent trends in the relations},

Title = {Premature mortality due to alcohol-related diseases of the liver in
   Poland according to voivodships},
Journal = {FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Background. Alcohol is one of the most serious public health threats
   facing the global population. Of all disease risk factors, alcohol ranks
   ninth place globally and sixth in Poland, with regards to DALYs
   (Disability-Adjusted Life Years). DALYs consist of two components: YLL
   (Years of Life Lost) and YLD (Years of Life with Disability).
   Objectives. The aim of the study was to assess the number of years of
   life lost due to alcohol-related diseases of the liver in the Polish
   population in 2013 according to voivodships.
   Material and methods. The study was based on 387,312 records obtained
   from the death certificates of Poles who died in 2013. The data on
   deaths caused by alcohol-related diseases of the liver (alcoholic liver
   disease, fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver) were used for the
   analysis. The SEYLL (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost) was used to
   calculate the years of life lost.
   Results. In 2013, alcohol-related diseases of the liver caused 6,126
   deaths of Poles, resulting in a loss of 129,578.8 years of life in the
   group of men (69.5 per 10,000) and 51,280.3 years in the group of women
   (25.8 per 10,000). The highest number of years of life lost was noted in
   the voivodships of Slaskie (102.5 per 10,000 males and 45.9 per 10,000
   females) and Lodzkie (97.3 and 33.6, respectively), and the lowest in
   Podkarpackie (49.3 and 10.4, respectively).
   Conclusions. Premature deaths caused by alcohol-related diseases of the
   liver are a considerable problem in the Polish population. The
   particular challenge in public health activities is to reduce the
   inconsistencies in health between voivodships.},

Title = {Premature mortality attributable to socioeconomic inequality in England
   between 2003 and 2018: an observational study},

Abstract = {Background Low socioeconomic position is consistently associated with
   increased risk of premature death. The aim of this study is to measure
   the aggregate scale of inequality in premature mortality for the whole
   population of England.
   Methods We used mortality records from the UK Office for National
   Statistics to study all 2 465 285 premature deaths (defined as those
   before age 75 years) in England between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2018.
   Socioeconomic position was defined using deciles of the Index of
   Multiple Deprivation: a measure of neighbourhood income, employment,
   education levels, crime, health, availability of services, and local
   environment. We calculated the number of expected deaths by applying
   mortality in the least deprived decile to other deciles, within the
   strata of age, sex, and time. The mortality attributable to
   socioeconomic inequality was defined as the difference between the
   observed and expected deaths. We also used life table modelling to
   estimate years-of-life lost attributable to socioeconomic inequality.
   Findings 35.6\% (95\% CI 35.3-35.9) of premature deaths were
   attributable to socioeconomic inequality, equating to 877 082 deaths, or
   one every 10 min. The biggest contributors were ischaemic heart disease
   (152 171 excess deaths), respiratory cancers (111 083) and chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (83 593). The most unequal causes of death
   were tuberculosis, opioid use, HIV, psychoactive drugs use, viral
   hepatitis, and obesity, each with more than two-thirds attributable to
   inequality. Inequality was greater among men and peaked in early
   childhood and at age 40-49 years. The proportion of deaths attributable
   to inequality increased during the study period, particularly for women,
   because mortality rates among the most deprived women (excluding
   cardiovascular diseases) plateaued, and for some diseases increased. A
   mean of 14.4 months of life before age 75 years are lost due to
   socioeconomic inequality. Interpretation One in three premature deaths
   are attributable to socioeconomic inequality, making this our most
   important public health challenge.

Title = {The impact of carbon monoxide on years of life lost and modified effect
   by individual- and city-level characteristics: Evidence from a
   nationwide time-series study in China},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {210},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Ambient carbon monoxide (CO) has been linked with mortality and
   morbidity. Little evidence is available regarding the relation between
   CO and years of life lost (YLL). Using data from 48 major cities in
   China from 2013 to 2017, we applied generalized additive models and
   random effects meta-analyses to explore the effects of CO on YLL from
   various diseases. Stratified analyses and meta-regression were performed
   to estimate potential effect modifications of demographic factors,
   regions, meteorological factors, co-pollutants, urbanization rate,
   economic level and health service level. Additional life gains due to
   avoidable YLL under certain scenario were also evaluated. Results
   indicated that a 1-mg/m(3) increase of CO concentrations (lagged over
   0-3 d), was associated with 2.08\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.35\%, 2.80\%), 2.35\% (95\% CI: 1.39\%, 3.30\%), 1.47\% (95\%
   CI:-0.01\%, 2.93\%), 2.28\% (95\% CI: 1.09\%, 3.47\%), 2.42\% (95\% CI:
   1.31\%, 3.54\%), 2.09\% (95\% CI: 0.47\%, 3.72\%) increments in daily
   YLL from non-accidental causes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory
   diseases, coronary heart disease, stroke and chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, respectively. These associations were robust to the
   adjustment of co-pollutants and varied substantially by geography and
   demographic characteristics. Associations were stronger in the elder
   people (>= 65 years), females, population with low education attainment,
   and lived in south region, than younger people, males, high educated
   populations and those lived in north region. Moreover, the harmful
   impact of increasing CO concentration could be attenuated by city-level
   characteristics, including the growth of urbanization rate, gross
   domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, number of hospital beds, doctors
   and hospitals. Finally, an estimated life of 0.081 (95\% CI:-0.027,
   0.190) years would be gained per deceased people if CO concentration
   could fall to 1 mg/m(3). In conclusions, this nationwide analysis showed
   significant associations between short-term CO exposure and
   cause-specific YLL. The heterogeneity of both in dividual and city-level
   characteristics should be considered for relevant intervention. These
   findings may have significant public health implications for the
   reduction of CO-attributed disease burden in China.},

Title = {Lost productivity due to premature mortality in developed and emerging
   countries: an application to smoking cessation},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Background: Researchers and policy makers have determined that
   accounting for productivity costs, or ``indirect costs,{''} may be as
   important as including direct medical expenditures when evaluating the
   societal value of health interventions. These costs are also important
   when estimating the global burden of disease. The estimation of indirect
   costs is commonly done on a country-specific basis. However, there are
   few studies that evaluate indirect costs across countries using a
   consistent methodology.
   Methods: Using the human capital approach, we developed a model that
   estimates productivity costs as the present value of lifetime earnings
   (PVLE) lost due to premature mortality. Applying this methodology, the
   model estimates productivity costs for 29 selected countries, both
   developed and emerging. We also provide an illustration of how the
   inclusion of productivity costs contributes to an analysis of the
   societal burden of smoking. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to
   assess productivity costs on the basis of the friction cost approach.
   Results: PVLE estimates were higher for certain subpopulations, such as
   men, younger people, and people in developed countries. In the case
   study, productivity cost estimates from our model showed that
   productivity loss was a substantial share of the total cost burden of
   premature mortality due to smoking, accounting for over 75 \% of total
   lifetime costs in the United States and 67 \% of total lifetime costs in
   Brazil. Productivity costs were much lower using the friction cost
   approach among those of working age.
   Conclusions: Our PVLE model is a novel tool allowing researchers to
   incorporate the value of lost productivity due to premature mortality
   into economic analyses of treatments for diseases or health
   interventions. We provide PVLE estimates for a number of emerging and
   developed countries. Including productivity costs in a health economics
   study allows for a more comprehensive analysis, and, as demonstrated by
   our illustration, can have important effects on the results and
   conclusions.},

Title = {The spatial pattern of premature mortality in Hong Kong: How does it

Abstract = {Research into understanding the relationship between access to housing,
   health and wellbeing in cities has yielded mixed evidence to date and
   has been limited to case studies from Western countries. Many studies
   appear to highlight the negative effects of public housing in
   influencing the health of its residents. Current trends in the urban
   housing markets in cities of advanced Asian economies and debates
   surrounding the role of government in providing housing underscore the
   need for more focused research into housing and health. In this paper,
   we investigate Hong Kong as an example of a thriving Asian city by
   exploring and comparing the intra-urban geographies of premature
   mortality and public housing provision in the city. Using a fully
   Bayesian spatial structural model, we estimate associations between
   public housing provision and different types of premature mortality. We
   find significant geographic variations in premature mortality within
   Hong Kong during the five-year period 2005-2009, with positive
   associations between the residents of public housing and premature
   mortality risk. But the associations attenuate or are even reversed for
   premature mortality of injuries and non-communicable diseases after
   controlling for local deprivation, housing instability, access to local
   amenities and other neighbourhood characteristics. The results indicate
   that public housing may have a protective effect on community health,
   which contradicts the findings of similar studies carried out in Western
   cities. We suggest reasons why the association between public housing
   and health differs in Hong Kong and discuss the implications for housing
   policy in Hong Kong and other Asian cities.},

Abstract = {Clozapine can cause severe adverse effects yet it is associated with
   reduced mortality risk. We test the hypothesis this association is due
   to increased clinical monitoring and investigate risk of premature
   mortality from natural causes. We identified 14 754 individuals (879
   deaths) with serious mental illness (SMI) including schizophrenia,
   schizoaffective and bipolar disorders aged >= 15 years in a large
   specialist mental healthcare case register linked to national mortality
   tracing. In this cohort study we modeled the effect of clozapine on
   mortality over a 5-year period (2007-2011) using Cox regression.
   Individuals prescribed clozapine had more severe psychopathology and
   poorer functional status. Many of the exposures associated with
   clozapine use were themselves risk factors for increased mortality.
   However, we identified a strong association between being prescribed
   clozapine and lower mortality which persisted after controlling for a
   broad range of potential confounders including clinical monitoring and
   markers of disease severity (adjusted hazard ratio 0.4; 95\% CI 0.2-0.7;
   p = .001). This association remained after restricting the sample to
   those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or those taking antipsychotics
   and after using propensity scores to reduce the impact of confounding by
   indication. Among individuals with SMI, those prescribed clozapine had a
   reduced risk of mortality due to both natural and unnatural causes. We
   found no evidence to indicate that lower mortality associated with
   clozapine in SMI was due to increased clinical monitoring or confounding
   factors. This is the first study to report an association between
   clozapine and reduced risk of mortality from natural causes.},

Title = {Association of Specific Mental Disorders With Premature Mortality in the
   Danish Population Using Alternative Measurement Methods},

Abstract = {This cohort study uses data from Danish health registers to generate
   estimates of years of life lost and life-years lost and to use these
   alternative measurement approaches to assess whether specific mental
   disorders are associated with premature mortality in the Danish
   population.
   Question Are specific types of mental disorders associated with
   premature mortality that can be quantified using alternative measurement
   approaches? Findings In this population-based cohort study of 6.9
   million individuals with and without mental disorders in Denmark, male
   and female persons diagnosed with any mental disorder had life
   expectancies of that were 11.2 years and 7.9 years shorter,
   respectively, compared with the general Danish population. Drug use
   disorders were associated with the highest rates of excess years of life
   lost; however, common mental disorders, such as depressive and anxiety
   disorders, were also associated with substantial premature mortality.
   Meaning The finding that mental disorders are associated with reductions
   in life expectancy can provide a foundation for future intervention
   programs designed to reduce the differential mortality gap associated
   with mental disorders.
   Importance The association of mental disorders with premature mortality
   published in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies has been
   underestimated because these analyses have recommended using only a
   small number of mental disorders as causes of death to estimate years of
   life lost (YLL). Alternative methods have been introduced, such as
   estimating life-years lost (LYL), to compare individuals with mental
   disorders with the general population. Objectives To generate
   register-based YLL and LYL estimates and to use these measurement
   methods to assess the association of specific mental disorders with
   premature mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants This
   population-based cohort study included all persons with and without
   mental disorders aged 0 to 94 years who were living in Denmark between
   January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from January
   to December 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures Danish health registers
   were used to identify mental disorder diagnoses, dates of death, and
   causes of death. The YLLs were estimated for the set of mental
   health-associated causes of death, and all-cause and cause-specific LYLs
   were estimated for 18 specific mental disorders and 3 broad categories
   of mental disorders that were recommended for use in the GBD studies.
   The association between the number of comorbid mental disorders (divided
   into categories of persons with >= 1 type of disorder, >= 2 types of
   disorders, >= 3 types of disorders, and >= 4 types of disorders) and LYL
   estimates was also examined. Results A total of 6989627 individuals
   (3481219 male persons {[}49.8\%] and 3508408 female persons {[}50.2\%];
   mean {[}SD] age at study enrollment, 32.2 {[}24.4] years) were followed
   up for a total of 85911461 person-years. The YLL rates per 100000
   person-years were highest for alcohol use disorder (for male
   individuals, 568.7 {[}95\% CI, 564.4-572.7]; for female individuals,
   155.5 {[}95\% CI, 153.5-157.9]) and suicide (for male individuals, 590.1
   {[}95\% CI, 583.8-596.5]; for female individuals, 202.3 {[}95\% CI,
   198.5-206.4]). Although only 3 of 18 mental and substance use disorders
   could be associated with YLL, all mental disorders were associated with
   shorter life expectancies when LYL was used for measurement. Male and
   female individuals diagnosed with any mental disorder had life
   expectancies that were shorter by 11.2 years (95\% CI, 11.1-11.3 years)
   and 7.9 years (95\% CI, 7.8-8.0 years), respectively, and remaining life
   expectancy decreased further among those with comorbid mental disorders.
   Drug use disorders were associated with the highest excess LYL
   estimates; however, common mental disorders, such as depressive and
   anxiety disorders, were also associated with substantial premature
   mortality. Conclusions and Relevance Mental disorders were observed to
   be associated with reductions in life expectancy. This finding provides
   a foundation for future intervention programs designed to reduce the
   differential mortality gap associated with mental disorders.
   Register-based studies allow the calculation of precise individual-level
   YLLs and LYLs, and both measurement methods are informative for health
   care planning. Compared with YLL, the novel LYL measurement approach may
   more precisely capture the association of mental disorders with
   premature mortality and facilitates the exploration of comorbidity and
   specific causes of death in individuals with mental disorders.},

Title = {Premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure and future policy
   roadmap for `airpocalypse' affected Asian megacities},

Abstract = {Fine particulate matter, PM2.5, has been associated with significant
   health effects including cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, cancer
   and premature deaths. The PM2.5-related health impacts are notable for
   megacities across the globe, but Asian megacities have been suffering
   much more. The Phenomenon of smog-hit cities became so common recently
   that the term `airpocalypse' has become synonymous with polluted air.
   This study reports PM2.5-related long-term mortality for the year 2016
   in 13 megacities of China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan using an
   integrated exposure risk (IER) model. This study assesses the mortality
   associated with health outcomes attributable to PM2.5 particularly:
   cerebrovascular disease (stroke, CEV), ischemic heart disease (IHD),
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC) among
   adults (>= 25years) and the acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) for
   infants (<5years). It further provides an estimation of the potential
   health benefits in future years under various scenarios realizing the
   PM2.5 concentration levels of (a) the goals of Air Pollution Prevention
   and Control Action Plan target (APPCAP) for China; (b) current policies
   (CP) and best practice emission control (BPEC) scenarios and (c) Interim
   Targets (ITs) and Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) for PM2.5 for all
   megacities.
   It is estimated that in 2016, PM2.5-related mortality in Shanghai,
   Beijing, Chongqing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Shenzhen was 17.6, 18.2,
   10.4, 9.8, 7.6 and 6.4 thousand respectively. In Indian megacities, the
   premature deaths were 14.8, 10.5, 7.3, 4.8 and 4.8 thousand in Delhi,
   Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Chennai respectively. Total mortality in
   Dhaka and Karachi was estimated to be 9.1 and 7.7 thousand. The CP is
   not enough to protect the public health in future in all the megacities.
   In China, PM2.5 levels will reduce under CP but PM2.5-related deaths
   will increase by 14-30\%, primarily due to increase in overall
   population growth and urban migration patterns. In other megacities, the
   PM2.5-related deaths will increase by 39.32-85\% in CP scenario, mostly
   due to the increase of PM2.5 in CP scenario. Though China has taken
   initial steps with pollution control targets and strategy, there is an
   urgent need for government policy in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
   This study highlights the need for urgency in setting up decisive air
   quality targets by megacity authorities and advocates for joint regional
   efforts to control air pollution. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical

Title = {Excessive premature mortality among children with cerebral palsy in

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background
   Studies from high-income countries reported reduced life expectancy in
   children with cerebral palsy (CP), while no population-based study has
   evaluated mortality of children with CP in sub-Saharan Africa. This
   study aimed to estimate the mortality rate (MR) of children with CP in a
   rural region of Uganda and identify risk factors and causes of death
   (CODs).
   Methods and findings
   This population-based, longitudinal cohort study was based on data from
   Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance System in eastern
   Uganda. We identified 97 children (aged 2-17 years) with CP in 2015,
   whom we followed to 2019. They were compared with an age-matched cohort
   from the general population (n = 41 319). MRs, MR ratios (MRRs), hazard
   ratios (HRs), and immediate CODs were determined.
   MR was 3952 per 100 000 person years (95\% CI 2212-6519) in children
   with CP and 137 per 100 000 person years (95\% CI 117-159) in the
   general population. Standardized MRR was 25 center dot 3 in the CP
   cohort, compared with the general population. In children with CP, risk
   of death was higher in those with severe gross motor impairments than in
   those with milder impairments (HR 6 center dot 8; p = 0 center dot 007)
   and in those with severe malnutrition than in those less malnourished
   (HR = 3 center dot 7; p = 0 center dot 052). MR was higher in females in
   the CP cohort, with a higher MRR in females (53 center dot 0; 95\% CI 26
   center dot 4-106 center dot 3) than in males (16 center dot 3; 95\% CI 7
   center dot 2-37 center dot 2). Age had no significant effect on MR in
   the CP cohort, but MRR was higher at 10-18 years (39 center dot 6; 95\%
   CI 14 center dot 2-110 center dot 0) than at 2-6 years (21 center dot 0;
   95\% CI 10 center dot 2-43 center dot 2). Anaemia, malaria, and other
   infections were the most common CODs in the CP cohort.
   Conclusions
   Risk of premature death was excessively high in children with CP in
   rural sub-Saharan Africa, especially in those with severe motor
   impairments or malnutrition. While global childhood mortality has
   significantly decreased during recent decades, this observed excessive
   mortality is a hidden humanitarian crisis that needs to be addressed.},

Title = {Mercury exposure and premature mortality in the Grassy Narrows First
   Nation community: a retrospective longitudinal study},

Abstract = {Background Little is known about the influence of toxic exposures on
   reduced life expectancy in First Nations people in Canada. The Grassy
   Narrows First Nation community have lived with the consequences of one
   of the worst environmental disasters in Canadian history. In the early
   1960s, 10 000 kg of mercury (Hg) was released into their aquatic
   ecosystem. Although Hg concentration in fish, their dietary staple,
   decreased over time, it remains high. We aimed to examine whether
   elevated Hg exposure over time contributes to premature mortality
   (younger than 60 years) in this community.
   Methods We did longitudinal and case-control analyses with data for
   individuals of the Grassy Narrows First Nation community. In 2019, the
   community obtained their historical Hg biomarker data from a government
   surveillance programme, which was then shared with the authors. A
   matched-pair approach allowed us to compare longitudinal hair Hg
   concentration between cases (individuals who died aged younger than 60
   years) and controls (individuals who lived beyond 60 years). Matching
   criteria included year of birth (allowing 2 years either side), sex, and
   a minimum of four hair Hg concentration measures, of which at least two
   were in the same year. Analyses included change-point detection,
   interrupted time series, mixed models, and Cox survival models.
   Findings We analysed data collected between Jan 1, 1970, and Jan 31,
   1997, for 657 individuals (319 women and 338 men, born between 1884 and
   1991) for whom we assembled a retrospective database of yearly measures
   of hair Hg concentration (n=3603). Hair Hg concentration decreased over
   time. A subgroup of 222 individuals (107 women and 115 men) reached or
   could have reached 60 years old by August, 2019. There was an increased
   risk of dying at a younger age among those with at least one hair Hg
   measure of 15 mu g/g or more (adjusted hazard ratio 1.55, 95\% CI
   1.11-2.16; p=0.0088). Among the deceased individuals (n=154), longevity
   decreased by 1 year with every 6.25 mu g/g (4.35-14.29) increase in hair
   Hg concentration. Analyses of 36 matched pairs showed that hair Hg
   concentration of those who died aged younger than 60 years was 4.7 times
   higher (3.4-5.9) than controls.
   Interpretation The consistent findings between our different analyses
   support an association between long-term Hg exposure from freshwater
   fish consumption and premature mortality in this First Nation community.
   There is a need to do risk-benefit analyses of freshwater fish
   consumption in environmentally contaminated regions.},

Title = {Specific differences and responses to reductions for premature mortality
   attributable to ambient PM2.5 in China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Although recent assessments have quantified the impact of ambient PM2.5
   on public health in China, air qualitymanagers would benefit from
   assessing specific differences in premature mortality and its responses
   to air quality improvement. Using PM2.5 data simulated by an
   observation-fused air quality model and an integrated exposureresponse
   model for the full range of PM2.5, we determined the premature mortality
   attributable to ambient PM2.5 across mainland China in 2016. Overall,
   the total number of PM2.5-related deaths nationwide was 1.31 million, of
   which lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart
   disease, and stroke represented 0.13, 0.13, 0.42, and 0.62 million,
   respectively. Per capita PM2.5-related mortality in China was 95 per
   100,000 personyears, and that of elderly people aged >= 75 years (1166
   deaths per 100,000) was much higher than that of young people aged 25-44
   years (11 deaths per 100,000). Additionally, there were significant
   spatial differences in premature deaths, which mainly occurred in
   regions with high PM2.5 levels or/and population density. Halving deaths
   across mainland China required an average of 63\% reduction of PM2.5
   nationwide and a decrease by 73\% in high concentration regions
   exceeding 70 mu g/m(3) and 19\% in lowconcentration locales below 10 mu
   g/m(3). Moreover, reducing PM2.5 to theWHO interim target I (IT-1) of 35
   mu g/m(3) would only result in a 12.6\% reduction in premature
   mortality, while a more exacting standard (reducing PM2.5 to 10 mu
   g/m(3)) would avoid 73.0\% of mortality. In particular, there is a large
   potential for reducing the high PM2.5-related mortality in heavily
   polluted locales. In conclusion, to further reduce premature mortality
   across mainland China, targets stricter than the IT-1 and tight policies
   to improve air quality and protect public health are necessary,
   especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and patients with
   cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, particularly in areas with high
   premature mortality. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Productivity Costs of Premature Mortality Due to Cancer in
   Australia: Evidence from a Microsimulation Model},

Abstract = {Aim
   To estimate the productivity costs of premature mortality due to cancer
   in Australia, in aggregate and for the 26 most prevalent cancer sites.
   Methods
   A human capital approach was adopted to estimate the long term impacts
   of Australian cancer deaths in 2003. Using population mortality data,
   the labour force participation and the present value of lifetime income
   (PVLI) forgone due to premature mortality was estimated based on
   individual characteristics at the time of death including age, sex and
   socioeconomic status. Outcomes were modelled to the year 2030 using
   economic data from a national microsimulation model. A discount rate of
   3\% was applied and costs were reported in 2016 Australian dollars.
   Results
   Premature deaths from cancer in 2003 resulted in 88,000 working years
   lost and a cost of \$4.2 billion in the PVLI forgone. Costs were close
   to three times higher in males than females due to the higher number of
   premature deaths in men, combined with higher levels of workforce
   participation and income. Lung, colorectal and brain cancers accounted
   for the highest proportion of costs, while testicular cancer was the
   most costly cancer site per death.
   Conclusions
   The productivity costs of premature mortality due to cancer are
   significant. These results provide an economic measure of the cancer
   burden which may assist decision makers in allocating scare resources
   amongst competing priorities.},

Abstract = {Background: Excess alcohol consumption is a major public health issue in
   Hungary, with high mortality rates from alcohol disease. In addition,
   excess alcohol consumption has been found to differ by socioeconomic and
   environmental factors. Methods: The spatial pattern of mortality from
   alcoholic liver disease across Hungary for the period 2005 and 2010, at
   municipality level, was investigated by sex using Bayesian modelling.
   The changes in mortality over this 6-year period were analysed using
   hierarchical spatio-temporal disease mapping. The association between
   the spatial distribution of mortality from alcoholic liver disease and
   cirrhosis and deprivation (by sex) was also assessed using a
   Hungarian-specific deprivation index. Results: A statistically
   significant association was found between mortality and deprivation
   status in males. Areas of significantly highest age-adjusted relative
   risks were found, for males, in the south-western part, and at the
   eastern border of the country. A number of areas showed area-specific
   trends that were significantly steeper than the national average
   mortality trend. Conclusion: Using our findings, population groups with
   increasing mortality trends were identified, which may help decision
   makers fund effective health promotion programmes to reduce mortality
   rates in the working-age population.},

Title = {Psychiatric disorder in early adulthood and risk of premature mortality
   in the 1946 British Birth Cohort},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Background: Few studies of the association between psychiatric disorder
   and premature death have adjusted for key confounders and used
   structured psychiatric interviews. We aimed to investigate if
   psychiatric disorder was associated with a higher risk of mortality and
   whether any excess mortality was due to suicide, or explained by other
   health or socioeconomic risk factors.
   Methods: We used data from the MRC National Survey of Health and
   Development, a nationally representative UK birth cohort. 3283 men and
   women completed the Present State Examination at age 36. The main
   outcome measure was all-cause mortality before age 60.
   Results: Those with psychiatric disorder at age 36 had a higher risk of
   death even after adjusting for potential confounders (Hazard ratio =
   1.84, 95\% C.I. 1.22-2.78). Censoring violent deaths and suicides led to
   similar results.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric disorder was associated with excess premature
   mortality not explained by suicide or other health or socioeconomic risk
   factors.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to quantify climate change-induced increase in
   premature mortality associated with temperature rise with corresponding
   socioeconomic implications in the context of an urban coastal city,
   taking the Greater Beirut Area as a study area. Future climatic
   conditions under four different emissions scenarios were considered to
   cover a broad spectrum of driving forces and potential social, economic
   and technologic evolutions. During the first half of the twenty-first
   century, the expected life losses due to high temperatures in hot days
   are offset by expected life gains due to improved temperatures in cold
   days, except under the scenario which characterizes fossil fuel
   intensive development. By the year 2095, the annual average all-cause
   premature mortality is expected to increase by 3-15 \%, depending on the
   scenario.},

Abstract = {The relative contributions of PM2.5 and ozone precursor emissions to air
   pollution-related premature mortality modulated by climate change are
   estimated for the U.S. using sensitivities of air pollutants to
   precursor emissions and health outcomes for 2001 and 2050. Result
   suggests that states with high emission rates and significant premature
   mortality increases induced by PM2.5 will substantially benefit in the
   future from SO2, anthropogenic NOX and NH3 emissions reductions while
   states with premature mortality increases induced by O-3 will benefit
   mainly from anthropogenic NOX emissions reduction. Much of the increase
   in premature mortality expected from climate change-induced pollutant
   increases can be offset by targeting a specific precursor emission in
   most states based on the modeling approach followed here.},

Abstract = {Black carbon (BC) mitigation can reduce adverse environmental impacts on
   climate, air quality, human health, and water resource availability. To
   facilitate the identification of mitigation priorities, we use a
   state-of-thescience global chemistry-climate coupled model (AM3), with
   additional tagged BC tracers representing regional (East Asia, South
   Asia, Europe and North America) and sectoral (land transport,
   residential, industry) anthropogenic BC emissions to identify sources
   with the largest impacts on air quality, human health and glacial
   deposition. We find that within each tagged region, domestic emissions
   dominate BC surface concentrations and associated premature mortality
   (generally over 90\%), as well as BC deposition on glaciers (similar to
   40-95\% across glaciers). BC emissions occurring within each tagged
   source region contribute roughly 1-2 orders of magnitude more to their
   domestic BC concentrations, premature mortality, and BC deposition on
   regional glaciers than that caused by the same quantity of BC emitted
   from foreign regions. At the sectoral level, the South Asian residential
   sector contributes 60\% of BC associated premature mortality in South
   Asia and similar to 40-60\% of total BC deposited on southern Tibetan
   glaciers. Our findings imply that BC mitigation within a source region,
   particularly from East and South Asian residential sectors, will bring
   the largest reductions in BC associated air pollution, premature
   mortality, and glacial deposition.},

Abstract = {Research has linked childhood abuse to a plethora of adverse health
   outcomes in adulthood(1,2). However, whether positive experiences in
   adulthood much beyond cessation of abuse exposure can offset these
   adverse health risks remains unclear. Using a sample of 6,078 adults
   from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States
   (MIDUS), we examined whether adult self-reported social support
   decreased mortality risk associated with self-reported exposure to three
   types of childhood abuse: severe physical abuse, modest physical abuse
   and emotional abuse. Greater self-reported social support was related to
   reduced mortality risk; however, this relation was qualified by exposure
   to childhood abuse. For each type of abuse, self-reported social support
   was linked to a larger reduction in mortality risk among individuals
   reporting childhood abuse compared with those reporting minimal or no
   exposure to abuse. These findings suggest that supportive relationships
   in midlife can partly offset the mortality risks that seem to be set in
   motion by childhood experiences of abuse.},

Abstract = {Objectives:To assess the burden of disease and disability in older
   persons in Mexico from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 study
   data.Methods:Analysis of the Mexican data from the GBD 2016 study is
   presented by state, sex, and stratified into four age groups: 60 to 69,
   70 to 79, 80 to 89, and 90+ years.Results:The majority of
   disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to disorders in
   persons 60+ in Mexico were due to premature mortality (68\%). Diabetes
   mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic kidney disease were the
   main causes of DALYs. With progressing age, sense organ diseases,
   dementias, and falls climbed to the top causes of years lived with
   disability (YLDs) in both sexes.Discussion:Most of the burden of disease
   in older Mexicans is due to premature mortality, underlining the need to
   strengthen the health system to respond better to health care needs of
   older persons with non-communicable diseases. This analysis provides
   information for the development of national health policies.},

Title = {The Impact of Pharmaceutical Innovation on Premature Mortality, Cancer
   Mortality, and Hospitalization in Slovenia, 1997-2010},

Abstract = {Background In Slovenia during the period 2000-2010, the number of years
   of potential life lost before the age of 70 years per 100,000 population
   under 70 years of age declined 25 \%. Objective The aim of this study
   was to test the hypothesis that pharmaceutical innovation played a key
   role in reducing premature mortality from all diseases in Slovenia, and
   to examine the effects of pharmaceutical innovation on the
   age-standardized number of cancer deaths and on hospitalization from all
   diseases. Estimates and other data were used to calculate the
   incremental cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical innovation in Slovenia.
   Method Longitudinal disease-level data was analyzed to determine whether
   diseases for which there was greater pharmaceutical innovation-a larger
   increase in the number of new chemical entities (NCEs) previously
   launched-had larger declines in premature mortality, the
   age-standardized number of cancer deaths, and the number of hospital
   discharges. My methodology controls for the effects of macroeconomic
   trends and overall changes in the healthcare system.
   Results Premature mortality from a disease is inversely related to the
   number of NCEs launched more than 5 years earlier. On average, the
   introduction of an additional NCE for a disease reduced premature
   mortality from the disease by 2.4 \% 7 years later. The age-standardized
   number of cancer deaths is inversely related to the number of NCEs
   launched 1-6 years earlier, conditional on the age-standardized number
   of new cancer cases diagnosed 0-2 years earlier. On average, the launch
   of an NCE reduced the number of hospital discharges 1 year later by
   approximately 1.5 \%.
   Conclusions The estimates imply that approximately two-thirds of the
   2000-2010 decline in premature mortality was due to pharmaceutical
   innovation. If no NCEs had been launched in Slovenia during 1992-2003,
   the age-standardized number of cancer deaths in 2008 would have been
   12.2 \% higher. The NCEs launched in Slovenia during 2003-2009 are
   estimated to have reduced the number of hospital discharges in 2010 by 7
   \%. If we assume that pharmaceutical expenditure was the only type of
   expenditure affected by pharmaceutical innovation, the cost per
   life-year saved was (sic)3,953, which is well below even the lowest
   estimates of the value of a life-year saved. Moreover, 85 \% of the
   increase in drug expenditure may have been offset by a reduction in
   hospital expenditure; therefore. the cost per life-year saved may have
   been only (sic)611.},

Abstract = {Mortality rates among adult men and women, inhabitants of the city of
   Wroclaw, were studied within 5-year age classes between 20 and 64 years
   of age relative to two social variables: education and marital status of
   the deceased. Age- and sex-specific mortality rates reveal a systematic
   social gradient. They are highest among persons with primary or `'basic
   vocational'' school education, lower among those with secondary school
   education, and lowest among those with college education. This gradient
   consistently appears in each of the age classes of males and females,
   although it is more pronounced among males. In both sexes, married
   persons have lower rates of mortality than those who have never married
   or were divorced or widowed. Among females, marital status appears to
   have a stronger effect on age-specific rates of mortality than
   educational status; the reverse is the case among males.  (C) 1993

Title = {Global premature mortality due to anthropogenic outdoor air pollution
   and the contribution of past climate change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Increased concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
   since preindustrial times reflect increased emissions, but also
   contributions of past climate change. Here we use modeled concentrations
   from an ensemble of chemistry-climate models to estimate the global
   burden of anthropogenic outdoor air pollution on present-day premature
   human mortality, and the component of that burden attributable to past
   climate change. Using simulated concentrations for 2000 and 1850 and
   concentration-response functions (CRFs), we estimate that, at present,
   470 000 (95\% confidence interval, 140 000 to 900 000) premature
   respiratory deaths are associated globally and annually with
   anthropogenic ozone, and 2.1 (1.3 to 3.0) million deaths with
   anthropogenic PM2.5-related cardiopulmonary diseases (93\%) and lung
   cancer (7\%). These estimates are smaller than ones from previous
   studies because we use modeled 1850 air pollution rather than a
   counterfactual low concentration, and because of different emissions.
   Uncertainty in CRFs contributes more to overall uncertainty than the
   spread of model results. Mortality attributed to the effects of past
   climate change on air quality is considerably smaller than the global
   burden: 1500 (-20 000 to 27 000) deaths yr(-1) due to ozone and 2200
   (-350 000 to 140 000) due to PM2.5. The small multi-model means are
   coincidental, as there are larger ranges of results for individual
   models, reflected in the large uncertainties, with some models
   suggesting that past climate change has reduced air pollution mortality.},

Title = {The Mediterranean diet and physical activity: better together than apart
   for the prevention of premature mortality},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION},
Abstract = {Diet and physical activity (PA) have been studied extensively in
   epidemiology as single or combined lifestyle factors; however, their
   interaction has not been studied thoroughly. Studying potential
   synergisms between lifestyle components with a comprehensive interaction
   analysis, including additive measures of interaction, provides key
   insights into the nature of their joint effect and helps target
   interventions more effectively. First, a comprehensive review was
   conducted to assess the potential research gap regarding reported
   interaction analyses conducted in studies assessing the Mediterranean
   diet (MedDiet) in combination with PA on all-cause mortality.
   Thereafter, we prospectively assessed the joint association of the
   MedDiet with PA on all-cause mortality in the Seguimiento Universidad de
   Navarra (SUN) cohort, followed by both multiplicative and additive
   interaction analyses. The conjoint effect of low adherence to the
   MedDiet and low PA observed an increased risk greater than the
   individual risk factors, suggesting a potential additive interaction or
   synergism between both exposures, with relative risk due to interaction
   (RERI) and (95 \% confidence interval (95 \% CI)) = 0.46 (-0.83 to 1.75)
   and attributable proportion (95 \% CI) due to interaction of 36 \%
   (-0.62, 1.34). No multiplicative interaction was detected. Studying
   interactions between lifestyle factors, such as the MedDiet and PA, is
   particularly relevant given the current research gaps in studying the
   complexities of combined aspects of lifestyle in comparison with
   isolated behaviours. Our findings underline the important public health
   message of adhering to both the MedDiet and PA for the prevention of
   premature mortality.},

Title = {Premature Mortality, Risk Factors, and Causes of Death Following
   Childhood-Onset Neurological Impairments: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {Background: Neurological impairment (NI) and disability are associated
   with reduced life expectancy, but the risk and magnitude of premature
   mortality in children vary considerably across study settings. We
   conducted a systematic review to estimate the magnitude of premature
   mortality following childhood-onset NI worldwide and to summarize known
   risk factors and causes of death.
   Methods: We searched various databases for published studies from their
   inception up to 31st October 2020. We included all cohort studies that
   assessed the overall risk of mortality in individuals with
   childhood-onset epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID), and deficits in
   hearing, vision and motor functions. Comparative measures of mortality
   such as the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), risk factors and causes
   were synthesized quantitatively under each domain of impairment. This
   review is registered on the PROSPERO database (registration number
   CRD42019119239).
   Results: The search identified 2,159 studies, of which 24 studies were
   included in the final synthesis. Twenty-two (91.7\%) studies originated
   from high-income countries (HICs). The median SMR was higher for
   epilepsy compared with ID (7.1 {[}range 3.1-22.4] vs. 2.9 {[}range
   2.0-11.6]). In epilepsy, mortality was highest among younger age groups,
   comorbid neurological disorders, generalized seizures (at univariable
   levels), untreatable epilepsy, soon after diagnosis and among cases with
   structural/metabolic types, but there were no differences by sex. Most
   deaths (87.5\%) were caused by non-epilepsy-related causes. For ID,
   mortality was highest in younger age groups and girls had a higher risk
   compared to the general population. Important risk factors for premature
   mortality were severe-to-profound severity, congenital disorders e.g.,
   Down Syndrome, comorbid neurological disorders and adverse pregnancy and
   perinatal events. Respiratory infections and comorbid neurological
   disorders were the leading causes of death in ID. Mortality is
   infrequently examined in impairments of vision, hearing and motor
   functions.
   Summary: The risk of premature mortality is elevated in individuals with
   childhood-onset NI, particularly in epilepsy and lower in ID, with a
   need for more studies for vision, hearing, and motor impairments.
   Survival in NI could be improved through interventions targeting
   modifiable risk factors and underlying causes.},

Abstract = {Objective. DM and PM are associated with substantial morbidity and
   mortality. We aimed to examine recent trends.
   Methods. Using The Health Improvement Network, we identified patients
   with incident DM/PM (defined by >= 1 Read diagnosis code) aged 18-89
   years with >= 1 year of continuous enrolment prior to the cohort entry
   date and up to 10 comparators matched on age, sex and entry year. The
   cohort was divided in two based on the year of DM/ PM diagnosis: the
   early cohort (1999-2006) and late cohort (2007-2014). We calculated
   multivariable hazard ratios (HR) for death using a Cox-proportional
   hazards model and multivariable rate differences (RD) using an additive
   hazard model.
   Results. We identified 410 DM cases (mean age: 58 years, 66\% female)
   and 407 PM cases (mean age: 59 years, 61\% female). Both DM cohorts had
   excess mortality compared with the comparison cohorts (71.5 vs 12.9
   deaths/1000 person-years {[}PY] in the early cohort and 49.1 vs 10.4
   deaths/1000 PY in the late cohort). The multivariable HRs were 7.51
   (95\% CI: 4.20, 13.42) in the early cohort and 5.42 (95\% CI: 3.11,
   9.45) in the late cohort (P-value for interaction = 0.59), and
   multivariable RDs were 56.2 (95\% CI: 31.8, 81.2) in the early cohort
   and 36.3 (95\% CI: 19.6, 53.0) in the late cohort (P-value for
   interaction = 0.15). A similar trend existed in PM.
   Conclusion. The premature mortality gap in DM/PM has not considerably
   improved in recent years, highlighting an unmet need for therapeutic
   improvement.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the relationship between income and mortality in
   Spain over a long period of declining in income inequality. The ratio
   between income in the richest and poorest provinces was 2.74 in 1970 and
   2.10 in 2010. Pearson correlation coefficients for the association
   between provincial income and the measures of mortality were estimated,
   as well as absolute and relative differences between the mortality rates
   of the poorest and richest provinces. The correlation coefficient
   between income and infant mortality decreased from -0.59 in 1970 to
   -0.17 in 2010, and lost significance from 1995 onwards. The coefficient
   for premature all-cause mortality increased from 0.04 in 1970 to 0.40 in
   2010, and acquired significance beginning in 2005. The coefficient also
   increased in mortality from cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive
   diseases. No association was found between provincial income and cancer
   mortality or mortality from injuries. The findings on premature
   mortality do not support the theory that decreasing income inequality
   will lead to reduced inequalities in mortality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {The impact of a Mediterranean diet and healthy lifestyle on premature
   mortality in men and women},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {94},

Pages = {913-920},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: The Mediterranean diet has been associated with reduced
   mortality; few studies have investigated the combined impact of the
   Mediterranean diet with other modifiable lifestyle factors.
   Objectives: The objectives were to investigate the association between
   adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total mortality and to estimate
   the overall impact of a combined healthy lifestyle on premature death.
   Design: In 1986 a cohort of 120,852 men and women aged 55-69 y provided
   information on dietary and other lifestyle habits. A mortality follow-up
   until 1996 was established by linkage to the Dutch Central Bureau of
   Genealogy. A combined lifestyle score was constructed by allocating one
   point per the following healthy lifestyle factors: adhering to the
   Mediterranean diet, nonsmoking, normal weight {[}BMI (in kg/m(2)): 18.5
   to <25], and regular physical activity. The lifestyle score ranged from
   0 to 4 points (least healthy to healthiest). The multivariate
   case-cohort analysis was based on 9691 deaths and 3576 subcohort
   members.
   Results: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly related
   to lower mortality in women but not significantly in men. The healthy
   lifestyle score was strongly inversely related to mortality in women and
   men. When the least-healthy to the healthiest lifestyle scores were
   compared, HRs of 4.07 (95\% CI: 2.59, 6.40; P-trend <0.001) and 2.61
   (95\% CI: 1.79, 3.80; P-trend <0.001) were shown in women and men,
   respectively. For the same comparison, the mortality rate advancement
   period ({''}aging effect{''}) was 15.1 y (95\% CI: 9.9, 20.2 y) in women
   and 8.4 y (95\% CI: 5.0, 11.8 y) in men.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that adherence to 4 modifiable healthy
   lifestyle factors can substantially reduce premature mortality in women
   and men. Am J Clin Nutr 2011;94:913-20.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Premature mortality from current ambient fine particulate (PM2.5)
   exposure in India is large, but the trend under climate change is
   unclear. Here we estimate ambient PM2.5 exposure up to 2100 by applying
   the relative changes in PM2.5 from baseline period (2001-2005) derived
   from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models to the
   satellite-derived baseline PM2.5. We then project the mortality burden
   using socioeconomic and demographic projections in the Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. Ambient PM2.5 exposure is
   expected to peak in 2030 under the RCP4.5 and in 2040 under the RCP8.5
   scenario. Premature mortality burden is expected to be 2.4-4 and
   28.5-38.8\% higher under RCP8.5 scenario relative to the RCP4.5 scenario
   in 2031-2040 and 2091-2100, respectively. Improved health conditions due
   to economic growth are expected to compensate for the impact of changes
   in population and age distribution, leading to a reduction in per capita
   health burden from PM2.5 for all scenarios except the combination of
   RCP8.5 exposure and SSP3.},

Abstract = {Intravenous infusion of recombinant human activated Factor VII (FVIIa)
   has been used for over a decade in the successful management of bleeding
   episodes in patients with inhibitory antibodies to Factor VIII or Factor
   IX. Previously, we showed that expression of murine FVIIa (mFVIIa) from
   an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector corrected abnormal hemostatic
   parameters in hemophilia B mice. To pursue this as a therapeutic
   approach, we sought to define safe and effective levels of FVIIa for
   continuous expression. In mice transgenic for mFVIIa. or injected with
   AAV-mFVIIa, we analyzed survival, expression levels, in vitro and in
   vivo coagulation tests, and histopathology for up to 16 months after
   birth/mFVIIa expression. We found that continuous expression of mFVIIa
   at levels at or below 1.5 mu g/ml was safe, effective, and compatible
   with a normal lifespan. However, expression levels of 2 mu g/ml or
   higher were associated with thrombosis and early mortality, with
   pathologic findings in the heart and lungs that were rescued in a
   low-factor X (low-FX) mouse background, suggesting a FX-mediated effect.
   The findings from these mouse models of continuous FVIIa expression have
   implications for the development of a safe gene transfer approach for
   hemophilia and are consistent with the possibility of thromboembolic
   risk of continuously elevated FVIIa levels.},

Abstract = {Geographical inequalities in premature mortality and the role of
   neighbourhood social determinants of health (SDOH) have been less
   explored. This study aims to assess the geographical inequalities in
   premature mortality in Taiwan and how neighbourhood SDOH contribute to
   them and to examine the place-specific associations between
   neighbourhood SDOH and premature mortality. We used township-level
   nationwide data for the years 2015 to 2019, including age-standardized
   premature mortality rates and three upstream SDOH (ethnicity, education,
   and income). Space-time scan statistics were used to assess the
   geographical inequality in premature mortality. A geographical and
   temporal weighted regression was applied to assess spatial heterogeneity
   and how neighbourhood SDOH contribute to geographic variation in
   premature mortality. We found geographical inequality in premature
   mortality to be clearly clustered around mountainous rural and
   indigenous areas. The association between neighbourhood SDOH and
   premature mortality was shown to be area-specific. Ethnicity and
   education could explain nearly 84\% variation in premature mortality.
   After adjusting for neighbourhood SDOH, only a handful of hotspots for
   premature mortality remained, mainly consisting of rural and indigenous
   areas in the central-south region of Taiwan. These findings provide
   empirical evidence for developing locally tailored public health
   programs for geographical priority areas.},

Title = {Place, Power, and Premature Mortality: A Rapid Scoping Review on the
   Health of Women in Appalachia},

Abstract = {Objective: Appalachian women continue to die younger than in other US
   regions. We performed a rapid scoping review to summarize women's health
   research in Appalachia from 2000 to 2019, including health topics, study
   populations, theoretical frameworks, methods, and findings.
   Data Source: We searched bibliographic databases (eg, PubMed, PsycINFO,
   Google Scholar) for literature focusing on women's health in Appalachia.
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Included articles were: (1) on
   women's health in Appalachia; (2) published January 2000 to June 2019;
   (3) peer-reviewed; and (4) written in English. We excluded studies
   without reported data findings.
   Data Extraction: Two coders reviewed articles for descriptive
   information to create summary tables comparing variables of interest.
   Data Synthesis: Two coders co-reviewed a sub-sample to ensure consensus
   and refine data charting categories. We categorized major findings
   across the social-ecological framework.
   Results: A search of nearly 2 decades of literature revealed 81
   articles, which primarily focused on cancer disparities (49.4\%) and
   prenatal/pregnancy outcomes (23.5\%). Many of these research studies
   took place in Central Appalachia (eg, 42.0\% in Kentucky) with
   reproductive or middle-aged women (82.7\%). Half of the studies employed
   quantitative methods, and half used qualitative methods, with few mixed
   method or community-engaged approaches (3.7\%). Nearly half (40.7\%) did
   not specify a theoretical framework. Findings included complex
   multi-level factors with few articles exploring the co-occurrence of
   factors across multiple levels.
   Conclusions: Future studies should: 1) systematically include
   Appalachian women at various life stages from under-represented
   sub-regions; 2) expand the use of rigorous methods and specified
   theoretical frameworks to account for complex interactions of
   social-ecological factors; and 3) build upon existing community assets
   to improve health in this vulnerable population.},

Title = {Relationship between premature mortality and socioeconomic factors in
   black and white populations of US metropolitan areas},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {116},
Number = {5},
Pages = {464-473},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Objective. This ecologic study examined the association of mortality
   with selected socioeconomic indicators of inequality and segregation
   among blacks and whites younger than age 65 in 267 US metropolitan
   areas. The primary aim of the analysis was to operationalize the concept
   of institutional racism in public health.
   Methods. Socioeconomic indicators were drawn from Census and vital
   statistics data for 1989-1991 and included median household income; two
   measures of income inequality; percentage of the population that was
   black; and a measure of residential segregation.
   Results. Age-adjusted premature mortality was 81\% higher in blacks than
   in whites, and median household income was 40\% lower. Income
   inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, was greater within the
   black population (0.45) than within the white population (0.40; p <
   0.001). To confirm that the proxy socioeconomic variables were relevant
   markers of population health status, regression analysis was performed
   initially on data for the total population. These variables were all
   independently and significantly related to premature mortality (p less
   than or equal to 0,01; R-2 = 0.74). Income inequality for the total
   population was significantly correlated with premature mortality (r =
   0.33). Black (r = 0.26) and white (r = 0.20) population-specific
   correlations between income inequality and premature mortality, while
   still significant, were smaller. Residential segregation was
   significantly related to premature mortality and income inequality for
   blacks (r = 0.38 for both); among whites, however, segregation was
   modestly correlated with premature mortality (r = 0.19) and uncorrelated
   with income inequality. Regional analyses demonstrated that the
   association of segregation with premature mortality was much more
   pronounced in the South and in areas with larger black populations.
   Conclusion. Social factors such as income inequality and segregation
   strongly influence premature mortality in the US. Ecologic studies of
   the relationships among social factors and population health can measure
   attributes of the social context that may be relevant for population
   health, providing the basis for imputing macro-level relationships.},

Title = {Effect of education and marital status on premature mortality among
   urban adults in Poland, 1988-1989},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {397-403},
Abstract = {Mortality rates among adults 25-64 years of age (premature mortality) in
   1988 and 1989 were compared by educational status (a four-level scale)
   and marital status (married vs. nonmarried) in three Polish cities
   situated in ecologically different regions of Poland. Each of the two
   social factors has a significant influence on mortality after the effect
   of the other is controlled statistically. The risk of premature death
   increases regularly with an individual's decreasing position on the
   educational scale; also, the risk is higher among nonmarried than among
   married persons. This is true in all three urban populations, at all age
   levels considered, and in both genders. However, the effects of
   education and of marital status on premature mortality are more dramatic
   in males than in females. At middle age, the condition of having no
   spouse and of being poorly educated each expose males to a greater risk
   of premature mortality than females. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Estimated Residential Exposure to Agricultural Chemicals and Premature
   Mortality by Parkinson's Disease in Washington State},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between estimated
   residential exposure to agricultural chemical application and premature
   mortality from Parkinson's disease (PD) in Washington State. Washington
   State mortality records for 2011-2015 were geocoded using residential
   addresses, and classified as having exposure to agricultural land-use
   within 1000 meters. Generalized linear models were used to explore the
   association between land-use associated with agricultural chemical
   application and premature mortality from PD. Individuals exposed to
   land-use associated with glyphosate had 33\% higher odds of premature
   mortality than those that were not exposed (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95\%
   Confidence Intervals (CI) = 1.06-1.67). Exposure to cropland associated
   with all pesticide application (OR = 1.19, 95\% CI = 0.98-1.44) or
   Paraquat application (OR = 1.22, 95\% CI = 0.99-1.51) was not
   significantly associated with premature mortality from PD, but the
   effect size was in the hypothesized direction. No significant
   associations were observed between exposure to Atrazine (OR = 1.21, 95\%
   CI = 0.84-1.74) or Diazinon (OR = 1.07, 95\% CI = 0.85-1.34), and
   premature mortality from PD. The relationship between pesticide exposure
   and premature mortality aligns with previous biological, toxicological,
   and epidemiological findings. Glyphosate, the world's most heavily
   applied herbicide, and an active ingredient in Roundup((R)) and
   Paraquat, a toxic herbicide, has shown to be associated with the odds of
   premature mortality from PD.},

Title = {Can China achieve a one-third reduction in premature mortality from
   non-communicable diseases by 2030?},
Journal = {BMC MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Background: The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals for 2030
   include reducing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases
   (NCDs) by one third. To assess the feasibility of this goal in China, we
   projected premature mortality in 2030 of NCDs under different risk
   factor reduction scenarios.
   Methods: We used China results from the Global Burden of Disease Study
   2013 as empirical data for projections. Deaths between 1990 and 2013 for
   cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
   cancer, and other NCDs were extracted, along with population numbers. We
   disaggregated deaths into parts attributable and unattributable to high
   systolic blood pressure (SBP), smoking, high body mass index (BMI), high
   total cholesterol, physical inactivity, and high fasting glucose. Risk
   factor exposure and deaths by NCD category were projected to 2030. Eight
   simulated scenarios were also constructed to explore how premature
   mortality will be affected if the World Health Organization's targets
   for risk factors reduction are achieved by 2030.
   Results: If current trends for each risk factor continued to 2030, the
   total premature deaths from NCDs would increase from 3.11 million to
   3.52 million, but the premature mortality rate would decrease by 13.1\%.
   In the combined scenario in which all risk factor reduction targets are
   achieved, nearly one million deaths among persons 30 to 70 years old due
   to NCDs would be avoided, and the one-third reduction goal would be
   achieved for all NCDs combined. More specifically, the goal would be
   achieved for CVD and chronic respiratory diseases, but not for cancer
   and diabetes. Reduction in the prevalence of high SBP, smoking, and high
   BMI played an important role in achieving the goals.
   Conclusions: Reaching the goal of a one-third reduction in premature
   mortality from NCDs is possible by 2030 if certain targets for risk
   factor intervention are reached, but more efforts are required to
   achieve risk factor reduction.},

Title = {Exploring sources of uncertainty in premature mortality estimates from
   fine particulate matter: the case of China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Atmospheric pollution from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the
   major concerns in China because of its widespread and harmful impacts on
   human health. In recent years, multiple studies have sought to estimate
   the premature mortality burden from exposure to PM(2.5)to inform policy
   decisions. However, different modeling choices have led to a wide array
   of results, with significant discrepancies both in the total mortality
   burden and in the confidence intervals. Here, we present a new
   comprehensive assessment of PM2.5-related mortality for China, which
   includes quantification of the main sources of variability, as well as
   of age and province-specific premature mortality trends during
   2015-2018. Our approach integrates PM(2.5)observations from more than
   1600 monitoring stations with the output of a high-resolution (8 km)
   regional simulation, to accurately estimate PM(2.5)fields along with
   their uncertainty, which is generally neglected. We discuss the
   sensitivity of mortality estimates to the choice of the
   exposure-response functions (ERFs), by comparing the widely used
   integrated exposure response functions (IERs) to the recently developed
   Global Exposure Mortality Models (GEMMs). By propagating the uncertainty
   in baseline mortalities, PM(2.5)and ERFs under a Monte Carlo framework,
   we show that the 95\% confidence intervals of mortality estimates are
   considerably wider than previously reported. We thus highlight the need
   for more epidemiological studies to constrain ERFs and we argue that
   uncertainty related to PM(2.5)estimate should be also incorporated in
   health impact assessment studies. Although the overall mortality burden
   remains vast in China (similar to 1.6 million premature deaths,
   according to GEMMs), our results suggest that 200 000 premature deaths
   were avoided and 195 billion US dollars were saved in 2018 compared to
   2015, bolstering the mounting evidence about the effectiveness of
   China's air quality policies.},

Title = {Air Pollution, Noise, Blue Space, and Green Space and Premature
   Mortality in Barcelona: A Mega Cohort},

Abstract = {Introduction: Cities often experience high air pollution and noise
   levels and lack of natural outdoor environments, which may be
   detrimental to health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects
   of air pollution, noise, and blue and green space on premature all-cause
   mortality in Barcelona using a mega cohort approach. Methods: Both men
   and women of 18 years and above registered on 1 January 2010 by the
   Sistema d'Informacio pel Desenvolupament de la Investigacio en Atencio
   Primaria (SIDIAP) and living in the city of Barcelona were included in
   the cohort and followed up until 31 December 2014 or until death (n =
   2,939,067 person years). The exposure assessment was conducted at the
   census tract level (n = 1061). We assigned exposure to long term ambient
   levels of nitrogen dioxides (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate
   matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), between 2.5
   mu m and 10 mu m (PM2.5-10, i.e., coarse particulate matter), less than
   10 mu m (PM10) and PM2.5 light absorption (hereafter referred to as
   PM2.5 absorbance) based on land use regressions models. Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was assigned based on remote sensing
   data, percentage green space and blue space were calculated based on
   land use maps and modelled road traffic noise was available through the
   strategic noise map for Barcelona. Results: In this large prospective
   study (n = 792,649) in an urban area, we found a decreased risk of
   all-cause mortality with an increase in green space measured as NDVI
   (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.92, 95\% CI 0.89-0.97 per 0.1) and increased
   risks of mortality with an increase in exposure to blue space (HR =
   1.04, 95\% CI 1.01-1.06 per 1\%), NO2 (HR = 1.01, 95\% CI 1.00-1.02 per
   5 ug/m(3)) but no risk with noise (HR = 1.00, 95\% CI 0.98-1.02 per 5
   dB(A)). The increased risks appeared to be more pronounced in the more
   deprived areas. Results for NDVI, and to a lesser extent NO2, remained
   most consistent after mutual adjustment for other exposures. The NDVI
   estimate was a little attenuated when NO2 was included in the model. The
   study had some limitations including e.g., the assessment of air
   pollution, noise, green space and socioeconomic status (SES) on census
   tract level rather than individual level and residual confounding.
   Conclusion: This large study provides new insights on the relationship
   between green and blue space, noise and air pollution and premature
   all-cause mortality.},

Abstract = {Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune
   disease that is a source of significantly decreased life expectancy in
   the United States. This study investigated causes of deaths among males
   and females with SLE. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study
   used the national death certificate database of approximate to 2.7
   million death records in the United States, 2014. SLE was defined using
   Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases codes:
   M32.1, M32.9, and M32.8. We compared sex-stratified demographic
   characteristics and the most commonly listed comorbidities in decedents
   with and without SLE. Relative risks (RRs) quantified the risk of dying
   with the most commonly listed comorbidities among decedents with SLE
   aged 50 years compared with non-SLE decedents. Results: There were 2,036
   decedents with SLE in the United States (86.2\% female). Female SLE
   decedents were 22 years younger than non-SLE females (median: 59 years
   vs. 81 years). This difference was 12 years among male decedents
   (median: 61 years vs. 73 years). The most frequently listed causes of
   death among female SLE decedents were septicemia (4.32\%) and
   hypertension (3.04\%). In contrast, heart disease (3.70\%) and diabetes
   mellitus with complications (3.61\%) were the most common among male SLE
   decedents. Among younger male decedents, SLE had higher co-occurrence of
   coagulation/hemorrhagic disorders and chronic renal failure compared
   with non-SLE (RR=16.69 {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\}=10.50-27.44]
   and RR=5.76 {[}95\% CI=2.76-12.00], respectively). These also
   contributed to premature mortality among women (RR=4.98 {[}95\%
   CI=3.69-6.70] and 8.55 {[}95\% CI=6.89-10.61], respectively).
   Conclusions: Our findings identify clinically relevant comorbidities
   that may warrant careful consideration in patients' clinical management
   and the natural history of SLE.},

Title = {HbA1c 3 months after diagnosis predicts premature mortality in patients

Abstract = {Aims To determine 5-year mortality rates, following the diagnosis of
   Type 2 diabetes, in a large local cohort of individuals with new onset
   of Type 2 diabetes seen within a few weeks of diagnosis in a single,
   community-based education programme. Methods We reviewed referrals for
   people with Type 2 diabetes to our service over 5 years from 1999 to
   2003 and determined, via regression analysis, which factors contributed
   significantly to mortality rates up to the end of 2007. Results A total
   of 3781 new referrals were reviewed with an approximate doubling of
   referral rates over 5 years (546 in 1999997 in 2003). Although the
   number of people developing the condition has increased, mortality rates
   over the 5 years from diagnosis has fallen from 11\% in 19999\% in 2003
   (P < 0.005) Age at diagnosis was the strongest predictor of mortality (P
   < 0.001) but HbA1c at 3 months after diagnosis (P < 0.001), systolic (P
   < 0.001) and diastolic (P = 0.05) blood pressure, smoking status (P <
   0.001) and gender (P = 0.04) were also significant predictors.
   Conclusions Our retrospective analysis adds weight to evidence
   suggesting that referral rates for people with Type 2 diabetes are
   increasing rapidly and that mortality rates are reducing but that the
   reasons for this are multifactorial. In addition to blood pressure,
   smoking and gender, the HbA1c achieved 3 months after the initial
   diagnosis also appears to predict subsequent mortality. It may be
   appropriate to consider early and intensive intervention for individuals
   with new onset type 2 diabetes.},

Title = {Changing risk factors that contribute to premature mortality from
   ambient air pollution between 2000 and 2015},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Exposure to ambient air pollution is a major global health risk factor.
   Using recently updated hazard ratio functions, we estimate that the
   global premature mortality burden attributable to ambient PM(2.5)and
   O(3)exposure increased by about 30\% and 17\%, respectively, from 2000
   to 2015. We analyzed these trends in terms of tradeoffs between changes
   in baseline mortality, population size, age distribution and exposure.
   Global population growth alone increased the mortality burden by about
   29\% and 42\% among adults and children, respectively. On the other
   hand, decreasing baseline mortality during the same period lowered the
   burden by about 18\% and 55\% among adults and children, respectively.
   In high-income countries, aging of the population contributed to
   increasing premature mortality, while in low-income countries, in
   Central and West Africa for example, the growing youth population
   reduced premature mortality. Our results show that improved air quality
   generally does not keep up with the increasing air pollution-associated
   disease burden in middle- and high-income countries. We conclude that
   improvements in health care that reduce baseline mortality along with
   air pollution mitigation strategies are needed to maximize benefits, and
   counter the growth and aging of the global population.},

Title = {An egalitarian society? Widening inequalities in premature mortality
   from non-communicable diseases in Australia, 2006-16},

Abstract = {Background: The recent slowdown in life expectancy increase in Australia
   has occurred concurrently with widening socioeconomic and geographical
   inequalities in all-cause mortality risk. We analysed whether, and to
   what extent, mortality inequalities among specific non-communicable
   diseases (NCDs) in Australia at ages 35-74 years widened during 2006-16.
   Methods: Registered deaths that occurred during 2006-16 in Australia
   were analysed. Inequalities were measured by area socioeconomic quintile
   {[}ranging from Q1 (lowest) to Q5 (highest)] and remoteness (major
   cities, inner regional, outer regional/remote/very remote).
   Age-standardized death rates (ASDR) for 35-74 years were calculated and
   smoothed over time.
   Results: NCD mortality inequalities by area socioeconomic quintile
   widened; the ratio of Q1 to Q5 ASDR for males increased from 1.96
   {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.91-2.01] in 2011 to 2.08 (2.03-2.13)
   in 2016, and for females from 1.78 (1.73-1.84) to 1.96 (1.90-2.02).
   Moreover, Q1 NCD ASDRs did not clearly decline from 2011 to 2016. CVD
   mortality inequalities were wider than for all NCDs. There were
   particularly large increases in smoking-related mortality inequalities.
   In 2016, mortality inequalities were especially high for chronic
   respiratory diseases, alcohol-related causes and diabetes. NCD mortality
   rates outside major cities were higher than within major cities, and
   these differences widened during 2006-16. Higher mortality rates in
   inner regional areas than in major cities were explained by
   socioeconomic factors.
   Conclusions: Widening of inequalities in premature mortality rates is a
   major public health issue in Australia in the context of slowing
   mortality decline. Inequalities are partly explained by major risk
   factors for CVDs and NCDs: being overweight or obese, lack of exercise,
   poor diet and smoking. There is a need for urgent policy responses that
   consider socioeconomic disadvantage.},

Title = {The Very High Premature Mortality Rate among Active Professional
   Wrestlers Is Primarily Due to Cardiovascular Disease},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Purpose: Recently, much media attention has been given to the premature
   deaths in professional wrestlers. Since no formal studies exist that
   have statistically examined the probability of premature mortality in
   professional wrestlers, we determined survival estimates for active
   wresters over the past quarter century to establish the factors
   contributing to the premature mortality of these individuals.
   Methods: Data including cause of death was obtained from public records
   and wrestling publications in wrestlers who were active between January
   1, 1985 and December 31, 2011. 557 males were considered consistently
   active wrestlers during this time period. 2007 published mortality rates
   from the Center for Disease Control were used to compare the general
   population to the wrestlers by age, BMI, time period, and cause of
   death. Survival estimates and Cox hazard regression models were fit to
   determine incident premature deaths and factors associated with lower
   survival. Cumulative incidence function (CIF) estimates given years
   wrestled was obtained using a competing risks model for cause of death.
   Results: The mortality for all wrestlers over the 26-year study period
   was. 007 deaths/total person-years or 708 per 100,000 per year, and 16\%
   of deaths occurred below age 50 years. Among wrestlers, the leading
   cause of deaths based on CIF was cardiovascular-related (38\%). For
   cardiovascular-related deaths, drug overdose-related deaths and cancer
   deaths, wrestler mortality rates were respectively 15.1, 122.7 and 6.4
   times greater than those of males in the general population. Survival
   estimates from hazard models indicated that BMI is significantly
   associated with the hazard of death from total time wrestling
   (p<0.0001).
   Conclusion: Professional wrestlers are more likely to die prematurely
   from cardiovascular disease compared to the general population and
   morbidly obese wrestlers are especially at risk. Results from this study
   may be useful for professional wrestlers, as well as wellness policy and
   medical care implementation.},

Title = {Aboriginal premature mortality within South Australia 1999-2006: a
   cross-sectional analysis of small area results},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Background: This paper initially describes premature mortality by
   Aboriginality in South Australia during 1999 to 2006. It then examines
   how these outcomes vary across area level socio-economic disadvantage
   and geographic remoteness.
   Methods: The retrospective, cross-sectional analysis uses estimated
   resident population by sex, age and small areas based on the 2006
   Census, and Unit Record mortality data. Premature mortality outcomes are
   measured using years of life lost (YLL). Subsequent intrastate
   comparisons are based on indirect sex and age adjusted YLL results. A
   multivariate model uses area level socio-economic disadvantage rank,
   geographic remoteness, and an interaction between the two variables to
   predict premature mortality outcomes.
   Results: Aboriginal people experienced 1.1\% of total deaths but 2.2\%
   of YLL and Aboriginal premature mortality rates were 2.65 times greater
   than the South Australian average. Premature mortality for Aboriginal
   and non-Aboriginal people increased significantly as area disadvantage
   increased. Among Aboriginal people though, a significant main effect for
   area remoteness was also observed, together with an interaction between
   disadvantage and remoteness. The synergistic effect shows the social
   gradient between area disadvantage and premature mortality increased as
   remoteness increased.
   Conclusions: While confirming the gap in premature mortality rates
   between Aboriginal South Australians and the rest of the community, the
   study also found a heterogeneity of outcomes within the Aboriginal
   community underlie this difference. The results support the existence of
   relationship between area level socio-economic deprivation, remoteness
   and premature mortality in the midst of an affluent society. The study
   concludes that vertically equitable resourcing according to population
   need is an important response to the stark mortality gap and its
   exacerbation by area socio-economic position and remoteness.},

Title = {The association between inhalable particulate matter and YLL caused by
   COPD in a typical city in northern China},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {26-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become the
   fourth-leading cause of death. The association between air pollution and
   years of life lost (YLL) caused by COPD is currently a hot topic;
   however, few studies have been published regarding COPD YLL around the
   world, especially in China, a highly polluted area.
   Aim: We investigated the exposure-response association between ambient
   particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 pm
   (PM10) and COPD YLL.
   Methods: We applied a generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate the
   short-term effects of PM10 on COPD YLL and mortality from 2002 to 2010
   in Tianjin.
   Results: The annual mean concentration of PM10 was 111.6 mu g/m(3). An
   increase in PM10 was significantly associated with daily YLL and
   mortality in a single pollutant model. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in the
   two-day moving average of PM10 was associated with the maximum YLL
   increment of 0.30 (95\% confidence interval: 0.06, 0.54) person-years
   and an excess risk (ER) of mortality of 0.60\% (0.20\%, 1.01\%). For YLL
   increases, the association is stronger in elderly (0.27 (0.06, 0.48),
   the cumulative effect) populations than in younger populations.
   Conclusions: An increment of COPD YLL is associated with an increased
   PM10 concentration. Elderly groups are more susceptible to air
   pollution. Strict air pollutant emission control is needed to protect
   public health.},

Title = {Menstrual cycle regularity and length across the reproductive lifespan
   and risk of premature mortality: prospective cohort study},
Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {371},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE
   To evaluate whether irregular or long menstrual cycles throughout the
   life course are associated with all cause and cause specific premature
   mortality (age <70 years).
   DESIGN
   Prospective cohort study.
   SETTING
   Nurses' Health Study 11 (1993-2017).
   PARTICIPANTS
   79 505 premenopausal women without a history of cardiovascular disease,
   cancer, or diabetes and who reported the usual length and regularity of
   their menstrual cycles at ages 14-17 years, 18-22 years, and 29-46
   years.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
   Hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for all cause and cause
   specific premature mortality (death before age 70 years) were estimated
   from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.
   RESULTS
   During 24 years of follow-up, 1975 premature deaths were documented,
   including 894 from cancer and 172 from cardiovascular disease. Women who
   reported always having irregular menstrual cycles experienced higher
   mortality rates during follow-up than women who reported very regular
   cycles in the same age ranges. The crude mortality rate per 1000 person
   years of follow-up for women reporting very regular cycles and women
   reporting always irregular cycles were 1.05 and 1.23 for cycle
   characteristics at ages 14-17 years, 1.00 and 1.37 for cycle
   characteristics at ages 18-22 years, and 1.00 and 1.68 for cycle
   characteristics at ages 29-46 years. The corresponding multivariable
   adjusted hazard ratios for premature death during follow-up were 1.18
   (95\% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.37), 1.37 (1.09 to 1.73), and 1.39
   (1.14 to 1.70), respectively. Similarly, women who reported that their
   usual cycle length was 40 days or more at ages 18-22 years and 29-46
   years were more likely to die prematurely than women who reported a
   usual cycle length of 26-31 days in the same age ranges (1.34,1.06 to
   1.69; and 1.40, 1.17 to 1.68, respectively). These relations were
   strongest for deaths related to cardiovascular disease. The higher
   mortality associated with tong and irregular menstrual cycles was
   slightly stronger among current smokers.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Irregular and long menstrual cycles in adolescence and adulthood are
   associated with a greater risk of premature mortality (age <70 years).
   This relation is slightly stronger among women who smoke.},

Title = {Estimating PM2.5-related premature mortality and morbidity associated
   with future wildfire emissions in the western US},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {Wildfire activity in the western United States (US) has been increasing,
   a trend that has been correlated with changing patterns of temperature
   and precipitation associated with climate change. Health effects
   associated with exposure to wildfire smoke and fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) include short- and long-term premature mortality, hospital
   admissions, emergency department visits, and other respiratory and
   cardiovascular incidents. We estimate PM2.5 exposure and health impacts
   for the entire continental US from current and future western US
   wildfire activity projected for a range of future climate scenarios
   through the 21st century. We use a simulation approach to estimate
   wildfire activity, area burned, fine particulate emissions, air quality
   concentrations, health effects, and economic valuation of health
   effects, using established and novel methodologies. We find that
   climatic factors increase wildfire pollutant emissions by an average of
   0.40\% per year over the 2006-2100 period under Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (lower emissions scenarios) and 0.71\%
   per year for RCP8.5. As a consequence, spatially weighted wildfire PM2.5
   concentrations more than double for some climate model projections by
   the end of the 21st century. PM2.5 exposure changes, combined with
   population projections, result in a wildfire PM2.5-related premature
   mortality excess burden in the 2090 RCP8.5 scenario that is roughly 3.5
   times larger than in the baseline period. The combined effect of
   increased wildfire activity, population growth, and increase in the
   valuation of avoided risk of premature mortality over time results in a
   large increase in total economic impact of wildfire-related PM2.5
   mortality and morbidity in the continental US, from roughly \$7 billion
   per year in the baseline period to roughly \$36 billion per year in 2090
   for RCP4.5, and \$43 billion per year in RCP8.5. The climate effect
   alone accounts for a roughly 60\% increase in wildfire PM2.5-related
   premature mortality in the RCP8.5 scenario, relative to baseline
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyse trends in socioeconomic
   inequalities in premature mortality in Barcelona from 1992 to 2011,
   accounting for population changes. We conducted a repeated
   cross-sectional study of the Barcelona population (25-64 years) using
   generalized linear mixed models for trend analysis, and found that
   socioeconomic inequalities in premature mortality persisted between
   neighbourhoods, but tended to diminish. However, the reduction in
   inequality was related to an increase in the number of foreign-born
   individuals mainly in socioeconomic disadvantaged neighbourhoods, in
   which the decrease in premature mortality was more marked. To study
   trends in geographical inequalities in mortality, it is essential to
   understand demographic changes occurred in different places related to
   local levels of deprivation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Small area differences in rates of mortality and long term illness are
   studied by a multi-level technique with a view to establishing the
   mediating effect of area context on the health-deprivation link for the
   populations of small areas. In particular, the question of whether
   deprivation has a less important association with health in rural as
   against urban contexts is considered. An examination of the effects of
   health service provision on health outcomes farms part of the higher
   level contextual setting within the multi-level analysis. The importance
   of model specification appropriate to analysis of morbidity and
   mortality rates is emphasized. A case study analysis involves a contrast
   between wards in London and East Anglia.},

Title = {Variation by ethnic group in premature mortality risk following
   self-harm: a multicentre cohort study in England},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Background: Incidence and risk factors for self-harm vary according to
   ethnicity. People who self- harm have been shown to have increased risk
   of premature death, but little is known about mortality following self-
   harm in ethnic minority groups.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study of self- harm presentations to three
   English cities (Derby, Manchester, Oxford) between 2000 and 2010. We
   linked to a national mortality dataset to investigate premature death in
   South Asian and Black people in comparison with White people to the end
   of 2012.
   Results: Ethnicity was known for 72 \% of the 28,512 study cohort
   members: 88 \% were White, 5 \% were South Asian, and 3 \% were Black.
   After adjusting for age, gender and area-level socioeconomic
   deprivation, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower in South Asian
   (hazard ratio {[}HR] 0.51, 95 \% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.42 - 0.62)
   and Black people (HR 0.46, 95 \% CI 0.39 - 0.55) versus White people.
   Suicide risk was significantly lower in Black people (HR 0.43, 95 \% CI
   0.19 - 0.97) than in White people. Prevalence of risk factors for
   premature death, such as previous self- harm, psychiatric treatment or
   concurrent alcohol misuse, was lower in South Asian and Black people
   than in White people.
   Conclusions: The risk of death following self-harm is lower in South
   Asian and Black people than White people in the UK, and they also have
   lower prevalence of risk factors for premature death. Awareness of both
   protective and risk factors might help to inform clinical decisions
   following assessment.},

Abstract = {Australians with severe mental illness experience inequitably high rates
   of physical illness and shortened life expectancy compared to the
   general population. A social analysis of this phenomenon incorporating a
   precis of historical and contemporary public health approaches reveals
   persistent discrimination and entrenched social disadvantage influencing
   access to appropriate physical health care. People with severe mental
   illness in Australia are among the most vulnerable and marginalized
   populations in society, with fragmented and inadequate health and social
   services materially influencing their physical health status and
   longevity. Enhanced multi-sectoral collaboration, integrated physical
   and mental health care models, empowerment strategies, and privileging
   of a lay perspective within program design are critical to challenging
   this enduring infringement on the human right to health.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Detailed data on the mortality of epilepsy are still lacking
   from resource-poor settings. We conducted a long-term follow-up survey
   in a cohort of people with convulsive epilepsy in rural areas of China.
   In this longitudinal prospective study we investigated the causes of
   death and premature mortality risk among people with epilepsy. Methods:
   We attempted to trace all 2,455 people who had previously participated
   in a pragmatic assessment of epilepsy management at the primary health
   level. Putative causes of death were recorded for those who died,
   according to the International Classification of Diseases. We estimated
   proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) for each cause, and standardized
   mortality ratios (SMRs) for each age-group and cause. Survival analysis
   was used to detect risk factors associated with increased mortality. Key
   Findings: During 6.1years of follow-up there were 206 reported deaths
   among the 1,986 people with epilepsy who were located. The highest PMRs
   were for cerebrovascular disease (15\%), drowning (14\%), self-inflicted
   injury (13\%), and status epilepticus (6\%), with probable sudden
   unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in 1\%. The risk of premature death
   was 2.9 times greater in people with epilepsy than in the general
   population. A much higher risk (SMRs 2837) was found in young people.
   Duration of epilepsy and living in a waterside area were independent
   predictors for drowning. Significance: Drowning and status epilepticus
   were important, possibly preventable, causes of death. Predictors of
   increasing mortality suggest interventions with efficient treatment and
   education to prevent premature mortality among people with epilepsy in
   resource-poor settings.},

Abstract = {Introduction The aim was to analyse whether age at first drug offense
   predicts premature mortality and morbidity due to substance use and
   violence among adolescents and young adults. Methods A prospective
   longitudinal register-linkage study based on a total population sample
   from Finland including individuals born between 1987 and 1992 and aged
   15-25 years during follow-up in 2002-2017 (n = 386 435). Age-specific
   rates of deaths and health-care admissions (morbidity) during a 5-year
   follow-up were calculated from the first drug offense. Cox regression
   models were used to estimate differences in mortality and morbidity at
   ages 21-25. Results Of all 15- to 20-year-olds, 1.4\% (n = 5540) have
   had a police contact. The 5-year mortality rates (per 1000 person-years)
   among those with first drug offense at ages 15-16 was 2.92 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.56-6.18], and 5.26 (CI 4.00-7.07) and 5.05
   (CI 4.06-6.38) at ages 17-18, and 19-20, respectively. The rates of
   morbidity varied between 61.20 (CI 52.43-71.76) and 87.51 (CI
   82.11-93.33). Both mortality and morbidity rates were over 10 times
   higher than among the general population. In models adjusted for family
   background, first police contact at an early age (15-16) did not
   increase the risk of mortality at ages 21-25 compared with first police
   contact at ages 17-18 (hazard ratio 1.55, CI 0.77-3.09) or 19-20 (hazard
   ratio 1.52, CI 0.78-2.98). The results were similar for morbidity.
   Discussion and Conclusions Adolescents with drug-related police contacts
   have high risk of mortality and morbidity due to substance use and
   violence regardless of age of first contact.},

Title = {Comparative analysis of premature mortality among urban immigrants in
   Bremen, Germany: a retrospective register-based linkage study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Objectives The main objective of this study was to explore differences
   in mortality patterns among two large immigrant groups in Germany: one
   from Turkey and the other from the former Soviet Union (FSU). To this
   end, we investigated indicators of premature mortality.
   Design This study was conducted as a retrospective population-based
   study based on mortality register linkage. Using mortality data for the
   period 2004-2010, we calculated age-standardised death rates (SDR) and
   standardised mortality ratios (SMR) for premature deaths (<age 65years).
   We computed years of potential life lost (YPLL) and analysed the
   underlying causes of death contributing to premature mortality.
   Setting and participants In this study, we made use of the unique
   possibilities of register-based research in relation to migration and
   health. Analyses were performed in three population groups in the
   federal state of Bremen, Germany: immigrants from Turkey, those from the
   FSU and the general population.
   Results The SDRs for premature deaths of the two immigrant groups were
   lower compared to those of the general population. The SMRs remained
   under 1. Using the indicator of YPLL, we observed higher
   age-standardised YPLL rates among immigrant populations, particularly
   among males from the FSU compared to females and population groups
   4238/100000, 95\% CI (4119 to 4358). Regarding main causes of premature
   death, we found larger contributions of infant mortality and diseases of
   the respiratory system among Turkish immigrants, and of injuries and
   poisonings, and mental and behavioural disorders among immigrants from
   the FSU.
   Conclusions While the overall trends favour the immigrant populations,
   the indicator of YPLL and cause-specific results indicate areas where
   the healthcare systems responsiveness may need to be improved, including
   preventive services. Further work with broader databases providing a
   similar level of differentiation is necessary to substantiate these
   findings.},

Title = {MODELING OF PREMATURE MORTALITY RATES FROM CHRONIC DISEASES IN EUROPE,
   INVESTIGATION OF CORRELATIONS, CLUSTERING AND GRANGER CAUSALITY},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Abstract = {In this study mortality rates due to chronic diseases in 31 European
   countries are examined, through certain time series modeling, based on
   the electronic database of Eurostat. The time series are grouped into 6
   clusters using Fuzzy K-means method combined with Jensen-Shannon
   divergence enabling a more accurate investigation of the homogeneity
   within clusters. The intuitive interpretation of these results relies on
   studies concerning the differentiation of Europeans' habits due to
   geopolitical position, nutritional, sociopolitical and environmental
   factors. Spearman coefficient, distance correlation and
   cross-correlation are used to reveal the underlying correlations while
   causality is checked through a parametric test, aiming to disclose the
   existence of Granger causality by examining all the pairs of the
   respective time series of premature mortality rates. Correlation indices
   and causality tests, highlight many statistically significant
   relationships with respect to their dynamics, comprehending the
   relationships governing the living standards of European countries.
   Finally, Europe's average mortality is modelled while special emphasis
   is given to the emergence of the ideal representative of Europe's rates.
   A detailed investigation of the relationships and patterns that
   characterize premature mortality from chronic diseases across Europe is
   provided, examining each country either individually or in connection to
   the other countries, while each statistically generated outcome is
   supported by results concerning the economic status, environment,
   nutrition and especially status of public health.},

   Mental Illness and Those in the General Population},

Abstract = {Objectives: The primary aim of this retrospective study of death records
   was to determine whether there were significant differences in years of
   potential life lost (YPLL) between decedents with serious and persistent
   mental illness at a community mental health center (N=647) and decedents
   in the general population (N=15,517) after the analysis adjusted for
   sociodemographic factors and cause of death. Methods: Clinical case
   management files from a community mental health center were matched to
   state death records from 1998 to 2004 to identify decedents being
   treated for a serious and persistent mental illness. Differences in
   leading causes of death and YPLL were calculated with descriptive and
   multi-variate methods. Results: Mean +/- SD YPLL for the decedents with
   serious and persistent mental illness was 14.5 +/- 10.6, compared with
   10.3 +/- 6.7 for the general population. Heart disease was the leading
   cause of death for both groups. Mean differences in YPLL after
   adjustment for gender, race, marital status, and education ranged from
   1.7 years for chronic lower respiratory disease to 13.1 years for
   accidents and were significant for every leading cause of death.
   Differences in cause of death did not explain the difference in YPLL.
   Suicide, cancer, accidents, liver disease, and septicemia were
   differentially associated with YPLL for persons with serious and
   persistent mental illness. Conclusions: Suicide, cancer, accidents,
   liver disease, and septicemia increased premature mortality among
   persons with serious and persistent mental illness. Along with ongoing
   suicide prevention programs, efforts to integrate primary and
   psychiatric care should focus on these preventable causes of early
   death. (Psychiatric Services 61: 663-668, 2010)},

Abstract = {Objective: Research has reported shortened lifespans (by 15-30 years)
   for those with severe mental illness (SMI) or substance use disorder
   (SUD), particularly among public mental health treatment consumers. We
   assessed SMIand SUD-associated mortality in the understudied setting of
   a large, nonprofit integrated health care system.
   Method: This retrospective cohort study examined 2010-2017 health system
   and death records for 564,592 adult patients. Half had SMI/SUD
   diagnosis; half were a demographically matched comparison group without
   SMI, other mental health, or SUD diagnoses. We estimated mortality
   risks, adjusting for demographic and physical health factors.
   Results: Having SMI or SUD was associated with higher odds of death
   (adjusted odds ratio = 1.87) and an average 6.3 years of earlier death
   relative to comparison individuals. Co-occurring SMI and SUD conferred
   higher mortality risk from major natural and unnatural causes than did
   SMI with no SUD.
   Conclusions: Some indicators of premature mortality were lower than
   those reported for U.S. public mental health consumers, but risk level
   varied widely by diagnosis. While patients' having insurance and broad
   access to care may lower risk, access to care may be insufficient to
   overcome the many patient-, provider-, and system-level factors
   contributing to poor physical health in SMI and SUD.},

Abstract = {Background: Studies conducted in the UK and Scandinavia show an inverse
   association between lifetime socioeconomic position and adult mortality.
   However, there are virtually no data from other countries and few
   investigations have examined non-cardiovascular mortality in men and
   women.
   Methods: Lifelong socioeconomic trajectories (father's occupation, own
   occupation in young adulthood and in mid-life) and premature ( <= 65
   years) mortality (all-cause, smoking-related cancer, diseases of the
   circulatory system and external causes) in the French GAZEL Cohort Study
   (14 972 men and 5598 women, followed up between 1990 and 2004) were
   studied. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox's regression
   models adjusted for age, marital status, tobacco smoking, alcohol
   consumption, body mass index, and fruit and vegetable consumption.
   Results: Men and women who experienced lifelong disadvantage or downward
   intergenerational mobility were at high risk of dying prematurely
   compared with those with a favourable trajectory (age-adjusted HRs for
   all-cause mortality: cumulative disadvantage: HR 1.61, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.26 to 2.06 in men and HR 1.95, 95\% CI 1.10 to 3.47 in
   women; downward mobility: HR 1.87, 95\% CI 1.35 to 2.58 in men and HR
   2.05, 95\% CI 1.12 to 3.75 in women). Associations were strongest for
   mortality due to chronic diseases (smoking-related cancers and diseases
   of the circulatory system). These associations were partly explained by
   marital status, body mass index, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking,
   and fruit and vegetable consumption.
   Conclusions: In France, where the leading cause of premature death is
   cancer, lifelong socioeconomic position is associated with the risk of
   dying before the age of 65 years. Adult factors seem more relevant than
   childhood socioeconomic circumstances.},

Abstract = {Background Economic cost estimates have the potential to provide a
   valuable alternative perspective on the COVID-19 burden. We estimate the
   premature mortality productivity costs associated with COVID-19 across
   Europe. Methods We calculated excess deaths between the date the
   cumulative total of COVID-19 deaths reached 10 in a country to 15th May
   2020 for nine countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The
   Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). Gender- and
   age-specific excess deaths and Years of Potential Productive Life Lost
   (YPPLL) between 30 and 74 years were calculated and converted into
   premature mortality productivity costs euro2020 for paid and unpaid work
   using the Human Capital and the Proxy Good Approaches. Costs were
   discounted at 3.5\%. Results Total estimated excess deaths across the
   nine countries were 18,614 (77\% in men) and YPPLL were 134,190 (77\%
   male). Total paid premature mortality costs were euro1.07 billion (87\%
   male) with Spain (euro0.35 billion, 33.0\% of total), Italy (euro0.22
   billion; 20.6\%) and The Netherlands (euro0.19 billion; 17.5\%) ranking
   highest. Total paid and unpaid premature mortality costs were euro2.89
   billion (77\% male). Premature mortality costs per death ranged between
   euro40,382 (France) and euro350,325 (Switzerland). Spain experienced the
   highest premature mortality cost as a proportion of Gross Domestic
   Product (0.11\%). Conclusion Even in the initial period of the pandemic
   in Europe, COVID-19-related premature mortality costs were significant
   across Europe. We provide policy makers and researchers with a valuable
   alternative perspective on the burden of the virus and highlight
   potential economic savings that may be accrued by applying timely public
   health measures.},

Title = {Adolescent conduct problems and premature mortality: follow-up to age 65

Abstract = {Background Severe youth antisocial behaviour has been associated with
   increased risk of premature mortality in high-risk samples for many
   years, and some evidence now points to similar effects in representative
   samples. We set out to assess the prospective association between
   adolescent conduct problems and premature mortality in a
   population-based sample of men and women followed to the age of 65
   years.
   Method A total of 4158 members of the Medical Research Council National
   Survey of Health and Development (the British 1946 birth cohort) were
   assessed for conduct problems at the ages of 13 and 15 years. Follow-up
   to the age of 65 years via the UK National Health Service Central
   Register provided data on date and cause of death.
   Results Dimensional measures of teacher-rated adolescent conduct
   problems were associated with increased hazards of death from
   cardiovascular disease by the age of 65 years in men {[}hazard ratio
   (HR) 1.17, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.32], and of all-cause
   and cancer mortality by the age of 65 years in women (all-cause HR 1.16,
   95\% CI 1.07-1.25). Adjustment for childhood cognition and family social
   class did little to attenuate these risks. Adolescent conduct problems
   were not associated with increased risks of unnatural/substance-related
   deaths in men or women in this representative sample.
   Conclusions Whereas previous studies of high-risk delinquent or offender
   samples have highlighted increased risks of unnatural and alcohol- or
   substance abuse-related deaths in early adulthood, we found marked
   differences in mortality risk from other causes emerging later in the
   life course among women as well as men.},

Abstract = {Objectives. To assess potential reductions in premature mortality that
   could have been achieved in 2008 to 2012 if the minimum wage had been
   \$15 per hour in New York City.
   Methods. Using the 2008 to 2012 American Community Survey, we performed
   simulations to assess how the proportion of low-income residents in each
   neighborhood might change with a hypothetical \$15 minimum wage under
   alternative assumptions of labor market dynamics. We developed an
   ecological model of premature death to determine the differences between
   the levels of premature mortality as predicted by the actual proportions
   of low-income residents in 2008 to 2012 and the levels predicted by the
   proportions of low-income residents under a hypothetical \$15 minimum
   wage.
   Results. A \$15 minimum wage could have averted 2800 to 5500 premature
   deaths between 2008 and 2012 in New York City, representing 4\% to 8\%
   of total premature deaths in that period. Most of these avertable deaths
   would be realized in lower-income communities, in which residents are
   predominantly people of color.
   Conclusions. A higherminimum wage may have substantial positive effects
   on health and should be considered as an instrument to address health
   disparities.},

Title = {Trends in inequalities in premature mortality: a study of 3.2 million

Abstract = {Background Over the last decades of the 20th century, a widening of the
   gap in death rates between upper and lower socioeconomic groups has been
   reported for many European countries. For most countries, it is unknown
   whether this widening has continued into the first decade of the 21st
   century.
   Methods We collected and harmonised data on mortality by educational
   level among men and women aged 30-74 years in all countries with
   available data: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England and Wales,
   Belgium, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Lithuania and
   Estonia.
   Results Relative inequalities in premature mortality increased in most
   populations in the North, West and East of Europe, but not in the South.
   This was mostly due to smaller proportional reductions in mortality
   among the lower than the higher educated, but in the case of Lithuania
   and Estonia, mortality rose among the lower and declined among the
   higher educated. Mortality among the lower educated rose in many
   countries for conditions linked to smoking (lung cancer, women only) and
   excessive alcohol consumption (liver cirrhosis and external causes). In
   absolute terms, however, reductions in premature mortality were larger
   among the lower educated in many countries, mainly due to larger
   absolute reductions in mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer
   (men only). Despite rising levels of education, population-attributable
   fractions of lower education for mortality rose in many countries.
   Conclusions Relative inequalities in premature mortality have continued
   to rise in most European countries, and since the 1990s, the contrast
   between the South (with smaller inequalities) and the East (with larger
   inequalities) has become stronger. While the population impact of these
   inequalities has further increased, there are also some encouraging
   signs of larger absolute reductions in mortality among the lower
   educated in many countries. Reducing inequalities in mortality
   critically depends upon speeding up mortality declines among the lower
   educated, and countering mortality increases from conditions linked to
   smoking and excessive alcohol consumption such as lung cancer, liver
   cirrhosis and external causes.},

Abstract = {Background Whether high burden of subclinical vascular disease (SVD) is
   associated with increased premature mortality among middle-aged adults
   is not adequately understood. The association of midlife SVD burden with
   premature mortality among middle-aged adults free of clinical
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) could provide further insights into
   stratifying premature death beyond clinical CVD. Objective To determine
   whether high burden of subclinical vascular disease is associated with
   increased premature mortality among middle-aged adults. Design We
   leveraged data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.
   Participants Thirteen thousand eight hundred seventy-six
   community-dwelling blacks and whites aged 45-64 years from the
   Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Main Measures Each SVD
   measure-ankle-brachial index, carotid intima-media thickness, and
   electrocardiogram-was scored 0 (no abnormalities), 1 (minor
   abnormalities), or 2 (major abnormalities). An index was constructed as
   the sum of three measures, ranging from 0 (lowest burden) to 6 (highest
   burden). We used the Cox proportional-hazards model to determine the
   association of SVD burden with premature mortality (death before age 70)
   among persons free of clinical CVD. We then tested the difference in
   point estimates between SVD and clinical CVD. Key Results Among persons
   without CVD, the premature death was 1.7, 2.1, 2.5, and 3.8 per 1000
   person-years among those with an SVD score of 0 (lowest burden), 1, 2,
   and 3-6 (highest burden), respectively. After multivariable-adjustment,
   highest SVD burden (score = 3-6; HR = 1.47) was significantly associated
   with premature death among persons initially without CVD. In the model
   where persons with and without CVD were included, high SVD burden
   (score: 3-6 vs. 0) and CVD did not have hugely different association
   with premature death (HR = 1.49 vs. 1.68; P = 0.32 for comparison).
   Conclusions Midlife SVD burden was associated with premature mortality
   and it could stratify premature death beyond clinical CVD. It is
   important to take SVD into account when designing interventions for
   reducing premature mortality.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine whether previously published estimates of
   attributable fractions of primary avoidable mortality (PAM) and
   secondary avoidable mortality (SAM) were valid to Australian public
   health physicians.
   Design: Self-administered survey.
   Setting: Australia-wide survey. Participants: 331 Fellows of the
   Australasian Faculty of Public Health Medicine (71.8\% response rate).
   Results: Tobias and Jackson's cited estimates for PAM and SAM for lung
   cancer were the least contested by respondents (62\% `no change'for PAM
   estimate; 67\% `no change'for SAM estimate). By contrast, 39\% indicated
   that the PAM estimate of 30\% for diabetes required change. Those
   most-contested PAM estimates also typically elicited significantly
   different responses by gender (breast cancer, diabetes and falls), age
   (breast cancer, stroke and diabetes) and training (stroke, diabetes,
   mental health). The proportion of respondents who agreed with the cited
   estimates either for PAM or SAM for any of the 10 selected conditions
   never differed significantly according to current primary role
   ('practitioner' v `researcher' v `other').
   Conclusions: PAM and SAM represent the key action areas for public
   health. We conclude that the estimates of Tobias and Jackson are
   generally robust among Australian public health physicians, invoking
   confidence that their advocacy will engage practitioners, policy makers
   and citizens seeking better governance of health system performance.},

Title = {Premature mortality in children aged 6-9 years with neurological
   impairments in rural Kenya: a cohort study},

Abstract = {Background Neurological impairments might significantly contribute to
   reduced life expectancy in low-income and middle-income countries
   (LMICs). There are no empirical studies of premature mortality in
   children with neurological impairments in Africa. This study estimated
   the risk of premature mortality in children with neurological
   impairments and identified risk factors and causes of death.
   Methods We did a cohort study based on a two-stage epidemiological
   survey in the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Kilifi,
   Kenya). Study participants were children aged 6-9 years. In the first
   stage, five trained field workers administered a low-cost screening tool
   to a random sample of households. In the second stage, we assessed for
   neurological impairments in five domains (epilepsy, cognitive
   impairments, vision impairments, hearing impairments, and motor
   impairments) using comprehensive clinical evaluation and extensive
   neuropsychological assessments. From the two-stage survey we identified
   a cohort of children with neurological impairment and a cohort of
   matched controls. We also enrolled an age-matched sample from the
   general population. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.
   Mortality rates, standardised mortality ratio (SMR), and hazard ratios
   (HR) for risk factors were estimated and causes of death identified.
   Findings We enrolled 306 children with neurological impairment, 9912
   survey controls, and 22 873 age-matched participants from the general
   population, and followed up the cohorts between June 1, 2001, and Aug
   31, 2018. Median follow-up was 14.5 years (IQR 8.6-17.2). 11 (3.9\%) of
   284 children with neurological impairment, 92 (1.0\%) of 9009 controls,
   and 272 (1.2\%) of 22 873 participants in the general population sample
   died during the follow-up. Overall mortality rates were 309.8 per 100
   000 person-years of observation (95\% CI 126.7-492.9) in children with
   neurological impairment, 80.8 per 100 000 person-years of observation
   (64.3-97.3) in controls, and 98.8 per 100 000 person-years of
   observation (87.1-110.6) in the general population sample (mortality
   rate ratio 3.83, 95\% CI 2.05-7.16, p<0.001, compared with controls;
   3.13, 1.71-572, p<0.001, compared with the general population).
   Mortality risk in children with neurological impairment was not
   dependent on the severity of impairment (p=0.291) nor on a specific
   neurological impairment domain (p=0.205). The overall risk of death
   adjusted for age and sex was higher in children with neurological
   impairment compared with controls (HR 4.24, 95\% CI 2.26-7.94, p=0.002).
   An SMR of 3.15 (95\% CI 1.66-5.49) was obtained after using the general
   population sample as the reference for indirect standardisation. In
   multivariable risk factor analysis, developmental delay (adjusted HR
   18.92, 95\% CI 2.23-160.44, p=0.007) and severe malnutrition (20.92,
   3.14-139.11, p=0.002) increased the risk of mortality in children with
   neurological impairment. Infections such as HIV/AIDS and accidents were
   common among all decedents.
   Interpretation The risk of premature mortality was higher in children
   diagnosed with neurological impairments compared with the general
   population and was increased by developmental delay and severe
   malnutrition. Child development and nutritional status should be
   assessed in all children in LMICs and tailored interventions started to
   improve outcomes. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {Background This study analysed the trend in mortality from nephrotic
   syndrome in Japan from 1995 to 2013. Moreover, to better understand
   premature death from nephrotic syndrome, the average years of life lost
   due to nephrotic syndrome were estimated.
   Methods National death certificate data were evaluated. Age-standardised
   mortality rates from nephrotic syndrome were calculated by direct
   standardisation using the World Standard Population. Trends for average
   annual changes in percentages were determined by joinpoint regression
   analysis. Average years of life lost were estimated by dividing total
   years of life lost by the number of deaths from nephrotic syndrome.
   Years of life lost were estimated by the constant end-point method, with
   65 years as the endpoint. Average years of life lost due to malignant
   neoplasms, the leading cause of death in Japan, were estimated for
   comparison.
   Results There were 9945 deaths (4872 men and 5073 women) during the
   study period. The numbers of deaths and crude overall mortality rates
   increased, while age-standardised mortality rates continuously
   decreased, for both sexes. The annual percentage changes were -1.9\%
   {[}95\% confidence interval (CI), -2.3 to -1.4\%] for men and -3.5\%
   (95\% CI -4.1 to -2.9\%) for women. The average years of life lost due
   to nephrotic syndrome decreased during the study period, but were
   greater than for patients who died of malignant neoplasm.
   Conclusions Mortality and premature mortality rates from nephrotic
   syndrome significantly decreased in Japan between 1995 and 2014. Despite
   these improvements, nephrotic syndrome patients <= 65 years of age still
   have a poor prognosis.},

Title = {Transition in source contributions of PM2.5 exposure and associated
   premature mortality in China during 2005-2015},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {132},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The serious fine particle (PM2.5) pollution in China causes millions of
   premature deaths. Driven by swift economic growth and stringent control
   policies, air pollutant emissions in China have changed significantly in
   the last decade, but the change in the source contribution of
   PM2.5-related health impacts remains unclear. In this study, we develop
   a multi-pollutant emission inventory in China for 2005-2015, and combine
   chemical transport modeling, ambient/household exposure evaluation and
   health impact assessment to quantify the contribution of eight emission
   sectors to PM2.5 exposure and associated health risk. From 2005 to 2015,
   the mortality due to PM2.5 from ambient air pollution (AAP) decreases
   from 1.04 (95\% confidence interval, 0.84-1.25) million to 0.87
   (0.70-1.04) million. The agricultural sector contributes 25\% and 32\%
   to ambient PM2.5-attributed mortality in 2005 and 2015, respectively,
   representing the largest contributor during this period. The
   contribution of power plants drops monotonously from 13\% to 6\%. The
   percentage contribution of industrial process drops significantly while
   the contribution of industrial combustion stays the same level. The
   overall contribution of industry is still as large as 26\% in 2015 in
   spite of strict control measures. For transportation, despite strict
   emission standards, its contribution increases remarkably due to the
   rapid growth of vehicle population. When both ambient and household
   PM2.5 exposures are taken into account, the mortality due to integrated
   population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 (IPWE) drops from 1.78 (1.46-2.09)
   million in 2005 to 1.28 (1.05-1.52) million in 2015. Most of the IPWE
   reduction comes from domestic combustion as a result of urbanization and
   improved income, whereas this sector remains the largest contributor
   (58\%) to IPWE-related health risk in 2015. Our results suggest that the
   government should dynamically adjust the air pollution control strategy
   according to the change in source contributions. Domestic combustion and
   agriculture should be prioritized considering their predominant
   contributions to mortality and the lack of effective control policies.
   More stringent control measures for industry and transportation are
   necessary since the existing policies have not adequately reduced their
   health impacts. Electricity production is no longer the top priority of

Title = {Contribution of fine particulate matter to present and future premature
   mortality over Europe: A non-linear response},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {153},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that around 7 million people die
   every year from exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) in polluted air.
   Here, the number of premature deaths in Europe from different diseases
   associated to the ambient exposure to PM2.5 have here been studied both
   for present (1991-2010) and future periods (2031-2050, RCP8.5 scenario).
   This contribution combines different state-of-the-art approaches (use of
   highresolution climate/chemistry simulations over Europe for providing
   air quality data; use of different baseline mortality data for specific
   European regions; inclusion of future population projections and
   dynamical changes for 2050 obtained from the United Nations (UN)
   Population Projections or use of non-linear exposure-response functions)
   to estimate the premature mortality due to PM2.5. The mortality
   endpoints included in this study are Lung Cancer (LC), Chronic
   Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cerebrovascular Disease (CEV),
   Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Lower Respiratory Infection (LRI) and
   other Non-Communicable Diseases (other NCDs). Different risk ratio and
   baseline mortalities for each disease end each age range have been
   estimated individually. The results indicate that the annual excess
   mortality rate from fine particulate matter in Europe is 904,000 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI) 733,100-1,067,800], increasing by 73\% in
   2050s (1,560,000; 95\% CI 1,260,000-1,840,000); meanwhile population
   decreases from 808 to 806 million according to the UN estimations. The
   results show that IHD is the main cause of premature mortality in Europe
   associated to PM2.5 (around 48\%) both for the present and future
   periods. Despite several marked regional differences, premature deaths
   associated to all the endpoints included in this study will increase in
   the future period due to the climate penalty but especially because of
   changes in the population projected and its aging.},

Abstract = {AIM: We considered risk factors for mortality in people admitted to
   Counties Manukau inpatient facilities, who were also identified by
   medical staff to have insufficient housing.
   METHOD: A cohort study of people aged 15 to 75 years admitted to
   Counties Manukau inpatient facilities were selected between 2002 and
   2014, with ICD-10 codes for insufficient housing. Diagnostic records
   identified people with substance use and other clinical conditions.
   Mortality records were used to track survival.
   RESULTS: During the study period, 1,182 individuals were identified, 126
   (10.7\%) of whom died during a median follow-up of 5.7 years. Median
   survival of the cohort was 63.5 years (95\% confidence interval (CI):
   58.7 to 69.9) which is about 20 years less than the general population.
   Of the cohort, the strongest associations with premature mortality were
   among people with cannabis-related disorders (adjusted hazard ratio
   {[}aHR] 2.15; 95\% CI: 1.10 to 4.22), diabetes (aHR 1.75; 95\% CI: 1.05
   to 2.93) and Maaori, compared to European and other ethnic groups,
   except Asian and Pacific (aHR 1.80; 95\% CI: 1.14 to 2.85).
   CONCLUSION: This population has high mortality. Within this group, Maori
   and people diagnosed with substance use and diabetes are at even higher
   risk of premature death.},

Title = {Forecasting life expectancy, years of life lost, and all-cause and
   cause-specific mortality for 250 causes of death: reference and
   alternative scenarios for 2016-40 for 195 countries and territories},

Abstract = {Background Understanding potential trajectories in health and drivers of
   health is crucial to guiding long -Lentil investments and policy
   itnpletnentation. Past work on forecasting has provided an incomplete
   landscape of future health scenarios, highlighting a need for a more
   robust modelling platform from which policy options and potential health
   trajectories can be assessed. This study provides a novel approach to
   modelling life expectancy, all -cause mortality and cause of death
   forecasts and alternative future scenarios for 250 causes of death from
   2016 to 2040 in 195 countries and territories.
   Methods We modelled 250 causes and cause groups organised by the Global
   Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) hierarchical
   cause structure, using GBD 2016 estimates from 1990-2016, to generate
   predictions for 2017-40. Our modelling framework used data from the GBD
   2016 study to systematically account for the relationships between risk
   factors and health outcomes for 79 independent drivers of health. We
   developed a three-component model of cause-specific mortality: a
   component due to changes in risk factors and select interventions; the
   underlying mortality rate for each cause that is a function of income
   per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility rate under 25
   years and time; and an autoregressive integrated moving average model
   for unexplained changes correlated with time. We assessed the
   performance by fitting models with data from 1990-2006 and using these
   to forecast for 2007-16. Our final model used for generating forecasts
   and alternative scenarios was fitted to data from 1990-2016. We used
   this model for 195 countries and territories to generate a reference
   scenario or forecast through 2040 for each measure by location.
   Additionally, we generated better health and worse health scenarios
   based on the 85th and 15th percentiles, respectively, of annualised
   rates of change across location-years for all the GBD risk factors,
   income per person, educational attainment, select intervention coverage,
   and total fertility rate under 25 years in the past. We used the model
   to generate all-cause age-sex specific mortality, life expectancy, and
   years of life lost (YLLs) for 250 causes. Scenarios for fertility were
   also generated and used in a cohort component model to generate
   population scenarios. For each reference forecast, better health, and
   worse health scenarios, we generated estimates of mortality and YLLs
   attributable to each risk factor in the future.
   Findings Globally, most independent drivers of health were forecast to
   improve by 2040, but 36 were forecast to worsen. As shown by the better
   health scenarios, greater progress might be possible, yet for some
   drivers such as high body-mass index (BMI), their toll will rise in the
   absence of intervention. We forecasted global life expectancy to
   increase by 4.4 years (95\% UI 2.2 to 6.4) for men and 4.4 years (2.1 to
   6.4) for women by 2040, but based on better and worse health scenarios,
   trajectories could range from a gain of 7.8 years (5.9 to 9.8) to a
   non-significant loss of 0.4 years (-2.8 to 2.2) for men, and an increase
   of 7.2 years (5.3 to 9.1) to essentially no change (0.1 years {[}-2.7 to
   2. 5]) for women. In 2040, Japan, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland had
   a forecasted life expectancy exceeding 85 years for both sexes, and 59
   countries including China were projected to surpass a life expectancy of
   80 years by 2040. At the same time, Central African Republic, Lesotho,
   Sotnalia, and Zimbabwe had projected life expectancies below 65 years in
   2040, indicating global disparities in survival are likely to persist if
   current trends hold. Forecasted YLLs showed a rising toll from several
   non-communicable diseases (NCDs), partly driven by population growth and
   ageing. Differences between the reference forecast and alternative
   scenarios were most striking for HIV/AIDS, for which a potential
   increase of 120-2\% (95\% UI 67.2-190.3) in YLLs (nearly 118 million)
   was projected globally from 2016-40 under the worse health scenario.
   Compared with 2016, NCDs were forecast to account for a greater
   proportion of YLLs in all GB D regions by 2040 (67.3\% of YLLs {[}95\%
   UI 61.9-72.3] globally); nonetheless, in many lower-income countries,
   communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases still
   accounted for a large share of YLLs in 2040 (eg, 53.5\% of YLLs {[}95\%
   UI 48.3-58.5] in Sub-Saharan Africa). There were large gaps for many
   health risks between the reference forecast and better health scenario
   for attributable YLLs. In most countries, metabolic risks amenable to
   health care (eg, high blood pressure and high plasma fasting glucose)
   and risks best targeted by population -level or intersectoral
   interventions (eg, tobacco, high BMI, and ambient particulate matter
   pollution) had some of the largest differences between reference and
   better health scenarios. The main exception was sub-Saharan Africa,
   where many risks associated with poverty and lower levels of development
   (eg, unsafe water and sanitation, household air pollution, and child
   malnutrition) were projected to still account for substantive
   disparities between reference and better health scenarios in 2040.
   Interpretation With the present study, we provide a robust, flexible
   forecasting platform from which reference forecasts and alternative
   health scenarios can be explored in relation to a wide range of
   independent drivers of health. Our reference forecast points to overall
   improvements through 2040 in most countries, yet the range found across
   better and worse health scenarios renders a precarious vision of the
   future a world with accelerating progress from technical innovation but
   with the potential for worsening health outcomes in the absence of
   deliberate policy action. For some causes of YLLs, large differences
   between the reference forecast and alternative scenarios reflect the
   opportunity to accelerate gains if countries move their trajectories
   toward better health scenarios or alarming challenges if countries fall
   behind their reference forecasts. Generally, decision makers should plan
   for the likely continued shift toward NCDs and target resources toward
   the modifiable risks that drive substantial premature mortality. If such
   modifiable risks are prioritised today, there is opportunity to reduce
   avoidable mortality in the future. However, CMNN causes and related
   risks will remain the predominant health priority among lower -income
   countries. Based on our 2040 worse health scenario, there is a real risk
   of HIV mortality rebounding if countries lose momentum against the HIV
   epidemic, jeopardising decades of progress against the disease.
   Continued technical innovation and increased health spending, including
   development assistance for health targeted to the world's poorest
   people, are likely to remain vital components to charting a future where
   all populations can live full, healthy lives. Copyright 2018 The

Abstract = {We examined risk of male premature mortality associated with recent
   criminal victimization. Prior victimization is among the most consistent
   predictors of future risk but the explanation of repeat victimization
   remains elusive. Two general perspectives frame this debate. According
   to the state-dependence perspective, repeat victimization is forged
   through intervening processes connecting an initial with a subsequent
   violent victimization. According to the risk-heterogeneity perspective,
   this association is spurious because all victimization events for a
   person result from underlying individual traits. Research on health
   outcomes and premature mortality provides related, but often overlooked,
   conceptual assumptions about the co-occurring health burden of
   preventable injuries and disease. We extend and apply each of these
   perspectives in the current study to assess the nature and sources of
   repeat violent victimization. Data were from the Izhevsk (Russia) Family
   Study, a large-scale population-based case-control study. Cases (n=1750)
   were all male deaths aged 25-54 living in Izhevsk between October 2003
   and October 2005. Controls (n=1750) were randomly selected from a city
   population register. Key independent variables were prior year
   prevalence of violent, property, and residential victimization. We used
   logistic regression to estimate mortality odds ratios. Results provided
   evidence for state dependence. We found that (i) after controlling for
   indicators of risk heterogeneity men who had been victims of violence
   (but not property or residential crime) within the past year were 2.6
   times more likely than those who had not to die prematurely; and (ii)
   the only type of death for which risk was higher was homicide. (C) 2016

Title = {Association of a Rheumatoid Arthritis Susceptibility Variant at the

   Patients},

Abstract = {Objective. To investigate whether recently identified rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA) susceptibility loci are also associated with disease
   severity, specifically all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
   mortality, in patients with inflammatory polyarthritis (IP).
   Methods. Subjects with recent-onset IP were recruited from the Norfolk
   Arthritis Register. Seventeen RA susceptibility single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested using Sequenom MassArray iPLEX
   chemistry. Vital status was ascertained from central records. The
   association of SNP allele carriage with mortality risk was assessed
   using Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting by sex. The
   mortality risks of those SNP alleles found to be associated were then
   stratified by baseline anti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody
   and shared epitope (SE) status.
   Results. All SNPs were successfully genotyped in 2,324 IP subjects. The
   presence of 2 copies of the risk allele rs2812378 mapping to the CCL21
   gene predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio {[}HR] 1.40, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}95\% CI] 1.04-1.87), whereas risk allele carriage
   also predicted increased CVD mortality (HR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.01-1.75). The
   highest mortality risks were seen in anti-CCP antibody-positive subjects
   with 2 copies of the CCL21 risk alleles and 2 copies of the SE
   (all-cause HR 3.20, 95\% CI 1.52-6.72; CVD HR 3.73, 95\% CI 1.30-10.72).
   Conclusion. In this large study, we found that carriage of CCL21 risk
   alleles was associated with premature mortality in IP independently of
   anti-CCP antibody and SE status. Interestingly, CCL21 expression has
   been reported in atherosclerotic plaques supporting the thesis that the
   increased CVD mortality in IP patients may be mediated by shared
   inflammatory mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Background: Home-fortification is a new strategy of adding
   micronutrients including zinc and iron to home-made foods. Zinc
   supplementation may prevent morbidity and mortality related to diarrheal
   illnesses, and iron supplementation may improve cognitive development,
   in children.
   Objectives: To project clinical and economic effects of
   home-fortification in children in an urban slum of Karachi, Pakistan.
   Methods: This is a cost benefit analysis of 5,000 simulated male and
   female infants (6-12 months) assigned to micronutrients or placebo for 4
   months and followed for 55 years. We linked the effect of zinc on
   longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea to mortality, and the effect of iron
   on hemoglobin to IQ scores and lifetime earnings. Cost estimates were
   based on volumes of resource utilization from the Pakistan Sprinkles
   Diarrhea study. Main outcome was incremental benefit defined as the gain
   in lifetime earnings after accounting for the incremental costs of
   micronutrients over placebo (societal perspective).
   Results: Our model projected that the reduction in diarrhea and
   improvement in hemoglobin concentrations through home-fortification was
   associated with reduced child mortality, higher IQ scores, and higher
   earnings. The present value of incremental benefit was \$106 (95 percent
   probability interval = \$17 to \$193) U.S. dollars, which corresponds to
   \$464.79 (\$74.54 to \$846.27) international dollars using a purchasing
   power parity exchange rate.
   Conclusions: Home-fortification appears to improve clinical outcomes at
   a reasonable cost, and may actually be cost beneficial when lifetime
   earnings are considered.},

Title = {Long-term satellite-based estimates of air quality and premature
   mortality in Equatorial Asia through deep neural networks},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Atmospheric pollution of particulate matter (PM) is a major concern for
   its deleterious effects on human health and climate. Over the past 50
   years, Equatorial Asia has experienced significant land-use change and
   urbanization, which have contributed to more intense and frequent
   extreme PM concentrations associated with increased anthropogenic and
   wildfire emissions. Recent advances in remote sensing instrumentation
   and retrieval protocols have enabled effective monitoring of PM from
   space in near real time with almost global coverage. In this study,
   long-term satellite-based observations of key chemical and physical
   parameters, integrated with ground-based concentrations of PM with
   aerodynamic diameter mu m (PM10) measured at 52 stations, are used to
   develop a machine learning approach for continuous PM(10)monitoring. As
   PM atmospheric pollution, like most of environmental processes, is
   highly non-linear and influenced by numerous variables, machine learning
   approaches seem very suitable. Herein, deep neural networks are
   developed and tested over different temporal scales and used to map
   PM(10)over Equatorial Asia during the period 2005-2015. The proposed
   model captures both PM(10)seasonal variability and the occurrence of
   extreme episodes, which are found to impact air quality on the regional
   scale. The modeled annual mean fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations are used
   to estimate long-term premature mortality. This study indicates that the
   region is experiencing increasing mortality rates related to long-term
   exposure to PM2.5, with 150 000 (108 000-193 000) premature deaths in
   2005 and 204 000 (145 000-260 000) in 2015. This is mostly due to air
   quality worsening and high population growth in urban areas, although
   the contribution of years of intense wildfires results as well
   significant.},

Abstract = {Health inequalities exist between nations, regions, and even smaller
   units. In societies where social and economic structures change rapidly
   and continuously, analysis of health socioeconomic determinants plays a
   fundamental role to provide proper policy answers. This study aims to
   measure accurately two different conceptions of deprivation by
   developing two different indexes using non-compensatory among
   sub-indicators aggregation methods. The proposed indicators are compared
   with premature mortality to verify deprivation's effect on health
   status. The results show that materially deprived areas are not
   necessarily socially deprived and vice versa. Material deprivation has a
   positive statistical co-graduation with premature mortality, while
   social deprivation has no association with premature mortality.},

Title = {Investigating the relationship between quality of primary care and

Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},

Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Objectives To quantify the relationship between a national primary care
   pay-for-performance programme, the UK's Quality and Outcomes Framework
   (QOF), and all-cause and cause-specific premature mortality linked
   closely with conditions included in the framework.
   Design Longitudinal spatial study, at the level of the ``lower layer
   super output area{''} (LSOA).
   Setting 32482 LSOAs (neighbourhoods of 1500 people on average), covering
   the whole population of England (approximately 53.5 million), from 2007
   to 2012.
   Participants 8647 English general practices participating in the QOF for
   at least one year of the study period, including over 99\% of patients
   registered with primary care.
   Intervention National pay-for-performance programme incentivising
   performance on over 100 quality-of-care indicators.
   Main outcome measures All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for
   six chronic conditions: diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, ischaemic
   heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. We used multiple
   linear regressions to investigate the relationship between spatially
   estimated recorded quality of care and mortality.
   Results All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates declined over the
   study period. Higher mortality was associated with greater area
   deprivation, urban location, and higher proportion of a non-white
   population. In general, there was no significant relationship between
   practice performance on quality indicators included in the QOF and
   all-cause or cause-specific mortality rates in the practice locality.
   Conclusions Higher reported achievement of activities incentivised under
   a major, nationwide pay-for-performance programme did not seem to result
   in reduced incidence of premature death in the population.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE
   The aims of the study were to assess how baseline leisure-time physical
   activity (LTPA) and its exercise components intensity, duration, and
   frequency are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in
   patients with type 1 diabetes 1) overall, 2) stratified by presence or
   absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 3) stratified by sex.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   The study design was prospective and observational and included 2,639
   patients with type 1 diabetes from the ongoing nationwide multicenter
   Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study. Mean follow-up time was
   11.4 +/- 6 3.5 years. LTPA was assessed by using a validated self-report
   questionnaire. Three hundred ten patients (11.7\%) had CKD defined as an
   estimated glomerular filtration rate of <= 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).
   RESULTS
   During follow-up, 270 deaths occurred. LTPA and all its components were
   associated with all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for the
   potential confounders sex, diabetic nephropathy, duration of diabetes,
   age at onset of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, BMI,
   and HbA(1c). Only exercise intensity was associated with cardiovascular
   mortality after adjustment for the confounders. Of the patients with
   CKD, 127 died during follow-up. The total amount of LTPA and exercise
   frequency were independently associated with lower risk of
   all-causemortality when adjusted for covariates.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Exercise is associated with a lower risk of premature all-cause and
   cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes. This study
   also demonstrates that physical activity is associated with a lower risk
   of mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes and CKD.},

Abstract = {Premature deaths constitute 31.1\% of all deaths in AdA(0). Analysis of
   the causes of premature deaths may be helpful in the evaluation of
   health risk factors. Moreover, findings of this study may enhance
   prophylactic measures.
   In 2001, 1857 randomly selected citizens, aged 18-64, were included in
   the Countrywide Integrated Noncommunicable Diseases Intervention (CINDI)
   Programme. In 2009, a follow-up study was conducted and information on
   the subjects of the study was collected concerning their health status
   and if they continued to live in AdA(0). The Cox proportional hazards
   model was used for evaluation of hazard coefficients. We adjusted our
   calculations for age and sex. The analysis revealed statistically
   significant associations between the number of premature deaths of the
   citizens of AdA(0) and the following variables: a negative
   self-evaluation of health - HR = 3.096 (95\% CI: 1.729-5.543), poor
   financial situation - HR = 2.811 (95\% CI: 1.183-6.672), occurring in
   the year preceding the study: coronary pain - HR = 2.754 (95\% CI:
   1.167-6.494), depression - HR = 2.001 (95\% CI: 1.222-3.277) and
   insomnia - HR = 1.660 (95\% CI: 1.029-2.678). Our research study also
   found a negative influence of smoking on the health status - HR = 2.782
   (95\% CI: 1.581-4.891). Moreover, we conducted survival analyses
   according to sex and age with Kaplan-Meier curves.
   The risk factors leading to premature deaths were found to be highly
   significant but possible to reduce by modifying lifestyle-related health
   behaviours. The confirmed determinants of premature mortality indicate a
   need to spread and intensify prophylactic activities in Poland, which is
   a post-communist country, in particular, in the field of cardiovascular
   diseases.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess the premature mortality risks caused
   by exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than
   2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and ozone elevated concentrations for the years 2000,
   2005, and 2020 in East Asia. The spatial distributions and temporal
   variations of PM2.5 and ozone concentrations are simulated using the
   Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System coupled with
   the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia. The premature mortality risks
   caused by exposure to PM2.5 and ozone are calculated based on a relative
   risk (RR) value of 1.04 (95 \% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.08) for
   PM2.5 concentrations above the annual mean limit of 10 mu g m(-3) taken
   from the World Health Organization-Air Quality Guideline and based on a
   RR value of 1.003 (95 \% CI: 1.001-1.004) for ozone concentration above
   35 ppb of the SOMO35 index (the sum of ozone daily maximum 8-h mean
   concentrations above 35 ppb). We demonstrate one of the implications of
   the policy making in the area of environmental atmospheric management in
   East Asia by highlighting the annual premature mortalities associated
   with exposure to PM2.5 concentrations that just meet an annual mean
   concentration of 10 mu g m(-3), as well as ozone concentrations that
   have a daily zero SOMO35 index in vulnerable places. Our results point
   to a growing health risk that may endanger human life in East Asia. We
   find that the effect of PM2.5 on human health is greater than the effect
   of ozone for the age group of 30 years and above. We estimate the
   corresponding premature mortality due to the effects of both ozone and
   PM2.5 in East Asia for the years 2000 and 2005 to be around 316,000 and
   520,000 cases, respectively. For future scenarios of the year 2020,
   policy succeed case, reference, and policy failed case, the estimated
   annual premature mortality rates are 451,000, 649,000, and 1,035,000
   respectively.},

Abstract = {This study examines the magnitude of alcohol-related premature death in
   the French population, which still has the highest average alcohol
   intake in the world and a relatively low coronary heart disease
   mortality rate. Two data sources were used: the national mortality data
   in 1990 and a prospective mortality experience in a cohort of 2,687
   middle-aged working men examined in 1980-1985 and followed-up during an
   average of 9.3 years. In the general population study, alcohol-related
   premature mortality (35-64 years) was calculated using
   alcohol-attributable fractions (AAFs) derived from studies of alcohol
   involvement in deaths from various causes. In the cohort, it was
   estimated from AAFs and attributable risk using both alcohol exposure
   prevalence and relative risks of death according to alcohol intake
   categories. In 1990, estimates of 19.1\% and 13.0\% of all premature
   deaths in French men and women were attributed to alcohol. Digestive
   diseases followed by malignant neoplasms in men and by unintentional
   injuries in women were major contributors to the total number of
   alcohol-related premature deaths. In the cohort study, 90 deaths
   occurred during the follow-up period. The estimation of alcohol-related
   premature mortality using AAFs was 24.4\%. The relative risk of total
   mortality (adjusted for age, smoking habits, and body mass index) for
   men who consumed >60 ml/day of alcohol, compared with those who consumed
   0-25 ml/day was 1.9 (95\% confidence interval: 1.1-3.5), The consumption
   of 26-60 ml/day was not associated with reduced risk of mortality, and
   the adjusted relative risk for this group was 1.3 (95\% confidence
   interval: 0.7-2.5). The estimated attributable risk of premature
   mortality caused by consumption of >25 ml/day of alcohol was 29.9\%.
   This study reports the persisting high alcohol-related premature
   mortality in the French general population, as well as in middle-aged
   working men. The results suggest that efforts should be paid to reduce
   further the consumption of alcohol in France.},

Abstract = {Aims: Productivity losses related to premature cancer mortality have
   been assessed for most developed countries but results for Russia are
   limited to cross-sectional reports. The aim of this study was to
   quantify productivity costs due to cancer mortality in Russia between
   2001 and 2015 and project this to 2030. Methods: Cancer mortality data
   (2001-2015) were acquired from the State Cancer Registry, whereas
   population data, labour force participation rates and annual earnings
   were retrieved from the Federal State Statistics Service. Cancer
   mortality was projected to 2030 and the human capital approach was
   applied to estimate productivity losses. Results: The total annual
   losses increased from US6.5b in 2001-2005 to US\$8.1b in 2011-2015,
   corresponding to 0.24\% of the annual gross domestic product. The value
   is expected to remain high in 2030 (US\$7.5b, 0.14\% of gross domestic
   product). Productivity losses per cancer death are predicted to grow
   faster in women (from US\$18,622 to US\$22,386) than in men (from
   US\$25,064 to US\$28,459). Total losses were found to be highest for
   breast cancer in women (US\$0.6b, 20\% of overall losses in women) and
   lung cancer in men (US\$1.2b, 24\%). The absolute predicted change of
   annual losses between 2011-2015 and 2026-2030 was greatest for cervix
   uteri (+US\$214m) in women and for lip, oral and pharyngeal cancers in
   men (+US\$182m). Conclusions: In Russia, productivity losses due to
   premature cancer mortality are substantial. Given the expected
   importance especially for potentially preventable cancers, steps to
   implement effective evidence-based national cancer control policies are
   urgently required.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less
   than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) has reached unprecedented levels in China and
   posed a significant threat to public health. Exploring the long-term
   trajectory of the PM2.5 attributable health burden and corresponding
   disparities across populations in China yields insights for policymakers
   regarding the effectiveness of efforts to reduce air pollution exposure.
   Therefore, we examine how the magnitude and equity of the PM2.5-related
   public health burden has changed nationally, and between provinces, as
   economic growth and pollution levels varied during 2005-2017. We derive
   long-term PM2.5 exposures in China from satellite-based observations and
   chemical transport models, and estimate attributable premature mortality
   using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). We characterize
   national and interprovincial inequality in health outcomes using
   environmental Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients over the study period.
   PM2.5 exposure is linked to 1.8 (95\% CI: 1.6, 2.0) million premature
   deaths over China in 2017, increasing by 31\% from 2005. Approximately
   70\% of PM2.5 attributable deaths were caused by stroke and IHD
   (ischemic heart disease), though COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease) and LRI (lower respiratory infection) disproportionately
   affected poorer provinces. While most economic gains and PM2.5-related
   deaths were concentrated in a few provinces, both gains and deaths
   became more equitably distributed across provinces over time. As a
   nation, however, trends toward equality were more recent and less clear
   cut across causes of death. The rise in premature mortality is due
   primarily to population growth and baseline risks of stroke and IHD.
   This rising health burden could be alleviated through policies to
   prevent pollution, exposure, and disease. More targeted programs may be
   warranted for poorer provinces with a disproportionate share of
   PM2.5-related premature deaths due to COPD and LRI. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Title = {Socioeconomic inequalities in premature mortality in Colombia,
   1998-2007: The double burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {41-47},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives. Non-communicable diseases have become the leading cause of
   death in middle-income countries, but mortality from injuries and
   infections remains high. We examined the contribution of specific causes
   to disparities in adult premature mortality (ages 25-64) by educational
   level from 1998 to 2007 in Colombia.
   Methods. Data from mortality registries were linked to population
   censuses to obtain mortality rates by educational attainment. We used
   Poisson regression to model trends in mortality by educational
   attainment and estimated the contribution of specific causes to the
   Slope Index of Inequality.
   Results. Men and women with only primary education had higher premature
   mortality than men and women with post-secondary education (RRmen =
   2.60, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 2.56, 2.64; RRwomen = 2.36, CI:
   2.31, 2.42). Mortality declined in all educational groups, but declines
   were significantly larger for higher-educated men and women. Homicide
   explained 55.1\% of male inequalities while non-communicable diseases
   explained 62.5\% of female inequalities and 27.1\% of male inequalities.
   Infections explained a small proportion of inequalities in mortality.
   Conclusion. Injuries and non-communicable diseases contribute
   considerably to disparities in premature mortality in Colombia.
   Multi-sector policies to reduce both interpersonal violence and
   non-communicable disease risk factors are required to curb mortality
   disparities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Measuring the effects of policy and social inequality is complicated
   because inequalities and policies may have delayed or accumulative
   effects on health. The objective of this study is to build on the body
   of work on population mortality and income inequality by investigating
   the association between income inequality and mortality at the city
   level at two points in time (1980 and 1990) as well as to determine
   whether indicators of 1980 social policies of cities are associated with
   1990 mortality rates due to delayed or accumulative effects. We found
   that 1980, income inequality and police spending is associated with
   increased premature mortality for 1990. In conclusion, there appear to
   be long-term consequences of city levels of income inequality on
   population health, although this relationship is incompletely
   understood. While a lack of information on how inequality operates on
   health should not preclude us from making policy decisions aimed at
   creating greater social equality, for example, through improvements in
   education, we would benefit from longitudinal research on specific
   macroeconomic and environmental factors, inequality, and health.
   Establishing such causal relationships is critical in creating social
   policies that optimally promote health and well-being.},

Abstract = {Background: Depression and anxiety are common in cancer and
   antidepressants (AD) are efficacious treatment. The relationship between
   AD adherence and mortality in cancer is unclear. This study aimed to
   evaluate the association between adherence to AD and all-cause mortality
   in a population-based cohort of patients with cancer. Materials and
   Methods: We conducted a 4-year historical prospective cohort study
   including 42,075 patients with cancer who purchased AD at least once
   during the study period. Adherence to AD was modeled as nonadherence
   (<20\%), poor (20-50\%), moderate (50-80\%), and good (>80\%) adherence.
   We conducted multivariable survival analyses adjusted for demographic
   and clinical variables that may affect mortality. Results: During
   1,051,489 person-years at risk follow-up, the adjusted hazard ratios
   (HR) for mortality were 0.89 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]:
   0.83-0.95), 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.66-0.72), and 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.76-0.85) for
   the poor, moderate, and good adherence groups, respectively, compared to
   the nonadherent group. Analysis of the entire sample and a subgroup with
   depression, for cancer subtypes, revealed similar patterns for breast,
   colon, lung, and prostate cancers, but not for melanoma patients.
   Multivariate predictors of premature mortality included male gender (HR
   1.48 {[}95\% CI: 1.42-1.55]), current/past smoking status (HR 1.1,
   {[}95\% CI: 1.04-1.15]; P < .0001), low socioeconomic status (HR 1.1,
   {[}95\% CI: 1.03-1.17]; P < .0001) and more physical comorbidities.
   Conclusions: The present study is the first to demonstrate that higher
   adherence to AD is associated with a decrease of all-cause mortality in
   a large nationwide cohort of cancer patients. Our data add to the
   pressing need to encourage adherence to AD among cancer patients.},

Title = {Cause and Age-specific premature mortality attributable to PM2.5
   Exposure: An analysis for Million-Plus Indian cities},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {710},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {In India, a majority population is exposed to high levels of ambient
   PM2.5 resulting in adverse health outcomes. Epidemiological studies have
   associated diseases such as Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD),
   Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
   (COPD), Lower Respiratory Infection (LRI), and Lung Cancer (LNC) to
   long-term PM2.5 exposure resulting in premature mortality. In the
   present work, the Integrated Exposure Response (IER) model is used to
   estimate such premature deaths for the year 2016 in 29 million-plus
   Indian cities. The city-specific registered deaths data along with
   information of percent share of cause-specific deaths in the total
   deaths and measured ambient PM2.5 concentrations are used to estimate
   cause-specific baseline mortality in a city. The premature mortality
   attributable to PM2.5 exposure is estimated from this baseline
   mortality. The premature mortality burden attributable to PM2.5 exposure
   in these cities is 114,700 (104,100-125,500) deaths from the five causes
   (IHD, Stroke, COPD, LRI, and LNC). IHD is the leading cause of death
   accounting for 58\% of PM2.5 related premature deaths, followed by
   Stroke (22\%), COPD (14\%), LRI (4\%), and LNC (2\%) in these 29 cities.
   The estimated number of PM2.5 related deaths in productive age group (25
   - 50 years) is quite low compared to older people, but the percentage
   share of these deaths in the cumulative cause-specific baseline deaths
   is higher for productive age group. Thus, the productive population is
   considerably at a higher risk of mortality due to PM2.5 exposure. There
   is approximately 18\% and 70\% reduction in premature mortality if these
   cities can attain National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (40 mu
   g/m(3)) and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (10 mu
   g/m(3)) of annual PM2.5, respectively. The estimates of air pollution
   related mortality at the city level could assist in city-specific policy
   formulation for better air pollution control. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Influence of Premature Mortality on the Link Between Type 2 Diabetes and

Abstract = {Context: Studies of hip fracture complicating diabetes have not
   considered the effect of premature mortality. Objective: The aim of our
   study was to determine influence of the competing risk of death on the
   association between type 2 diabetes and hip fracture.
   Design: The study was designed as a longitudinal observational study.
   Setting: The study setting was an urban community.
   Patients: Participants included 1291 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean
   age 64.0 years) and 5159 matched residents without diabetes.
   Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures were incident hip
   fracture hospitalizations and deaths. Hip fracture risk was assessed
   using proportional hazards and competing risk regression modeling.
   Results: During a mean of 14.1 years of follow-up, the incidence rate
   ratio for first hip fracture hospitalization in participants with vs
   without diabetes was 1.33 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.05 to
   1.68; P = 0.013]. Type 2 diabetes was associated with a cause-specific
   hazard ratio (csHR) for hip fracture of 1.50 (95\% CI, 1.19 to 1.89; P,
   0.001) and a subdistribution hazard ratio (sdHR) of 1.21 (95\% CI, 0.96
   to 1.52; P = 0.11) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities. In
   patients with diabetes, significant csHRs for incident hip fracture were
   male sex (protective), body mass index (protective), insulin use, and
   renal impairment. These variables, with increasing age, also had
   significant sdHRs.
   Conclusions: The diabetes-associated risk of hip fracture is attenuated
   after allowing for the competing risk of death. Risk factors for hip
   fracture in diabetes were those in reported in general population
   studies plus insulin use.},

Abstract = {This study examined years of potential life lost (YPLL) before age 65
   years to assess the relative impact of human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) versus other leading
   causes of death on premature mortality in New York City, New York,
   between 1983 and 1994, Most causes of death showed substantial
   year-to-year variation in YPLL, with the exception of HIV/AIDS. The YPLL
   attributed to HIV/AIDS increased monotonically from 11,866 in 1983 to
   167,317 in 1994, a nearly 15-fold increase, The rank order of the
   relative contribution of HIV/AIDS to total YPLL changed from the eighth
   leading cause of death to the leading cause. YPLL from heart disease,
   which ranked second in 1983, declined to fourth in 1994, homicide was
   unchanged, and chronic liver disease declined from fifth to ninth rank.
   The annual YPLL attributed to malignant neoplasms was similar to that
   for heart disease, but peaked in 1984, and the reduction over the
   subsequent decade was about 13\%, Total YPLL was 78\% greater among
   males than among females in 1983 and was nearly twice as high in 1994.
   premature mortality decreased steadily for non-Hispanic whites, from
   150,967 to 135,027 years for the years 1983-1994, while increasing 20\%
   among blacks (from 179,176 to 215,826 years) and 48\% among Hispanics
   (from 89,869 to 132,869 years). Among blacks and Hispanics, homicide
   contributed move years of YPLL than did either heart disease or
   malignant neoplasms in every year of observation. The HIV/AIDS epidemic
   and mortality associated with violence have become important public
   health challenges to the health and well-being of New Yorkers.},

   health, environment, and ecosystem. In the present study, the associated
   health risk mortality (age > 25) and welfare loss for the year 2017 due
   to excess PM2.5 concentration in ambient air for 31 major million-plus
   non-attainment cities (NACs) in India is assessed. The cities for the
   assessment are prioritised based on population and are classified as `X'
   (> 5 million population) and `Y' (1-5 million population) class cities.
   Ground-level PM2.5 concentration retrieved from air quality monitoring
   stations for the NACs ranged from 33 to 194 mu g/m(3). Total PM2.5
   attributable premature mortality cases estimated using global exposure
   mortality model was 80,447 {[}95\% CI 70,094-89,581]. Ischemic health
   disease was the leading cause of death accounting for 47\% of total
   mortality, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD-17\%), stroke (14.7\%), lower respiratory infection (LRI-9.9\%)
   and lung cancer (LC-1.9\%). 9.3\% of total mortality is due to other
   non-communicable diseases (NCD-others). 7.3-18.4\% of total premature
   mortality for the NACs is attributed to excess PM2.5 exposure. The total
   economic loss of 90,185.6 {[}95\% CI 88,016.4-92,411] million US\$ (as
   of 2017) was assessed due to PM2.5 mortality using the value of
   statistical life approach. The highest mortality (economic burden) share
   of 61.3\% (72.7\%) and 30.1\% (42.7\%) was reported for `X' class cities
   and North India zone respectively. Compared to the base year 2017, an
   improvement of 1.01\% and 0.7\% is observed in premature mortality and
   economic loss respectively for the year 2024 as a result of policy
   intervention through National Clean Air Action Programme. The
   improvement among 31 NACs was found inconsistent, which may be due to a
   uniform targeted policy, which neglects other socio-economic factors
   such as population, the standard of living, etc. The study highlights
   the need for these parameters to be incorporated in the action plans to
   bring in a tailored solution for each NACs for better applicability and
   improved results of the programme facilitating solutions for the complex
   problem of air pollution in India.},

Journal = {REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC

Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Objective. To examine the historical trends of premature death due to
   cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (CVD-DM) in the Caribbean
   and to identify any associations between these trends and health care
   expenditure.
   Methods. Death data were obtained from the World Health Organization
   Mortality Database; population data, from the United Nations World
   Population prospects; and health care expenditure data, from the World
   Bank. In all, 17 Caribbean countries had mortality data; however, only
   11 had both mortality and health care expenditure data available. The
   analyses explored country-level trends in age-standardized CVD-DM
   mortality rates using 3-year moving averages from 1995 - 2014 for women
   and men. Associations between secular mortality rate change and health
   care expenditure were considered.
   Results. CVD-DM mortality rates ranged from 10.7 - 247.1 per 100 000,
   with a mean of 92.3 and standard deviation of 47.6. Of the 17 countries,
   12 showed a reduction in premature CVD-DM mortality in both men and
   women, with others either showing no improvement or increases. Mortality
   rates for men were 1.46 times higher than for women. On average, there
   was a 68\% increase in health care expenditure, with a 15.4\% fall in
   CVD-DM mortality in women and 4.9\% in men. Mixed effects modelling
   demonstrated a weak association between health care expenditure and
   declining CVD-DM mortality for both women -0.006 (95\%CI = -0.014 -
   0.001) and men -0.008 (95\%CI = -0.017 - 0.001).
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that progress has been made to reduce
   premature CVD-DM related mortality in a number of Caribbean countries.
   Differences between countries may be partly related to differences in
   health care system performance, although further research that considers
   confounders is needed.},

Title = {Years of potential life lost and valued years of potential life lost in
   assessing premature mortality in Slovenia},
Journal = {CROATIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {439-445},

Abstract = {Aim. To determine the leading causes of death that contribute most to
   premature mortality in Slovenia; to classify premature mortality
   according to the cause of death, age, and sex; and to determine the age
   point before which premature mortality becomes a potential loss to the
   society.
   Method. Potential economic losses to society were estimated by use of
   years of potential life lost (YPLL), with a cut-off point at 65 years,
   and valued years of potential life lost (VYPLL) methods. We calculated
   the sex-, age-, and underlying causes of death-specific YPLL and VYPLL
   for residents of Slovenia who died at age younger than 65 years, using
   Slovene sex-specific life expectancy for 1998/1999 and age-specific
   weights of investment-producer-consumer model.
   Results. In 1998, 4,558 YPLL per 100,000 population were lost to
   Slovenia. We found bimodal age distribution of YPLL, with the first peak
   in the 20-24 year age group and the second in the 45-49 year age group.
   Men to women rate ratio was 2.5. The leading causes of YPLL were
   external causes of death, followed by malignant neoplasms, and
   cardiovascular diseases. External causes, including suicides and traffic
   accidents, were the leading causes of death in men, whereas malignant
   neoplasms, including breast cancer and digestive cancer, were
   top-ranking causes in women. Among those, only external causes of death
   produced positive VYPLL, indicating a net loss to the society.
   Conclusion. In Slovenia, YPLL peaked in the 20-24 and 45-49 year age
   groups. Only external causes of death, most of which were preventable,
   accounted for the net economic loss to Slovenian society. We believe
   that YPLL and VYPLL, as specific mortality measures, can be reliably
   used in the evaluation of leading causes of death before age 65 and
   potential economic loss to the society caused by those deaths, and that
   they should be taken into account when setting public health priorities.},

Abstract = {This modeling study presents the sectoral contributions of anthropogenic
   emissions in the four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and
   Sweden) on air pollution levels and the associated health impacts and
   costs over the Nordic and the Arctic regions for the year 2015. The
   Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) has been used on a 50 km
   resolution over Europe in tagged mode in order to calculate the response
   of a 30 \% reduction of each emission sector in each Nordic country
   individually. The emission sectors considered in the study were energy
   production, non-industrial/commercial heating, industry, traffic,
   off-road mobile sources and waste management/agriculture. In total, 28
   simulations were carried out. Following the air pollution modeling, the
   Economic Valuation of Air Pollution (EVA) model has been used to
   calculate the associated premature mortality and their costs. Results
   showed that more than 80 \% of the PM2.5 concentration was attributed to
   transport from outside these four countries, implying an effort outside
   the Nordic region in order to decrease the pollutant levels over the
   area. The leading emission sector in each country was found to be
   non-industrial combustion (contributing by more than 60 \% to the total
   PM2.5 mass coming from the country itself), except for Sweden, where
   industry contributed to PM2.5 with a comparable amount to non-industrial
   combustion. In addition to non-industrial combustion, the next most
   important source categories were industry, agriculture and traffic. The
   main chemical constituent of PM2.5 concentrations that comes from the
   country itself is calculated to be organic carbon in all countries,
   which suggested that nonindustrial wood burning was the dominant
   national source of pollution in the Nordic countries. We have estimated
   the total number of premature mortality cases due to air pollution to be
   around 4000 in Denmark and Sweden and around 2000 in Finland and Norway.
   These premature mortality cases led to a total cost of EUR 7 billion in
   the selected Nordic countries. The assessment of the related premature
   mortality and associated cost estimates suggested that non-industrial
   combustion, together with industry and traffic, will be the main sectors
   to be targeted in emission mitigation strategies in the future.},

Title = {Exploring the uncertainty associated with satellite-based estimates of
   premature mortality due to exposure to fine particulate matter},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {3499-3523},
Abstract = {The negative impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure on
   human health are a primary motivator for air quality research. However,
   estimates of the air pollution health burden vary considerably and
   strongly depend on the data sets and methodology. Satellite observations
   of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been widely used to overcome limited
   coverage from surface monitoring and to assess the global population
   exposure to PM2.5 and the associated premature mortality. Here we
   quantify the uncertainty in determining the burden of disease using this
   approach, discuss different methods and data sets, and explain sources
   of discrepancies among values in the literature. For this purpose we
   primarily use the MODIS satellite observations in concert with the
   GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. We contrast results in the United
   States and China for the years 2004-2011. Using the Burnett et al.
   (2014) integrated exposure response function, we estimate that in the
   United States, exposure to PM2.5 accounts for approximately 2 \% of
   total deaths compared to 14 \% in China (using satellite-based
   exposure), which falls within the range of previous estimates. The
   difference in estimated mortality burden based solely on a global model
   vs. that derived from satellite is approximately 14 \% for the US and 2
   \% for China on a nationwide basis, although regionally the differences
   can be much greater. This difference is overshadowed by the uncertainty
   in the methodology for deriving PM2.5 burden from satellite
   observations, which we quantify to be on the order of 20 \% due to
   uncertainties in the AOD-to-surface-PM2.5 relationship, 10 \% due to the
   satellite observational uncertainty, and 30 \% or greater uncertainty
   associated with the application of concentration response functions to
   estimated exposure.},

Abstract = {In many countries obesity has increased dramatically during the last
   decades, while there has been a parallel decrease in smoking. The
   objective of the present study was to estimate the net effect on
   premature mortality of these trends. A simulation model was developed to
   estimate the expected number of deaths between ages 19-56 years for
   cohorts of young men (n = 50,000), depending on inputs of obesity and
   smoking prevalence. The model was populated with nationwide data of
   Swedish men performing mandatory military conscription tests between
   1969 and 2005. Risk equations for all cause mortality with smoking and
   obesity status as predictors were developed based on the 1969-1970
   conscription cohort (n = 45,920; 2,897 deaths, median follow-up 38
   years). It was found that between 1969 and 2005, the prevalence of
   smoking decreased from 58.6 to 23.2\%, while overweight increased from
   5.7 to 15.6\% and obesity from 0.8 to 5.5\%. As a result of these
   trends, a 14\% (CI95\% 6, 21\%) reduction of premature deaths between
   ages 19 and 56 years was forecasted for men aged 19 year in 2004-2005
   compared to men aged 19 years in 1969-1970 (2,679 vs. 3,116 deaths).
   However, one-third of the survival benefit from reduced smoking during
   the period was offset due to the parallel increase in obesity. This
   study shows that despite large increases in overweight and obesity, a
   continued decline in premature deaths among Swedish males is expected
   due to reduced smoking during the last four decades.},

Abstract = {Ambient air pollution is one of eight global risk factors for deaths and
   accounts for 38.44 all causes death rates attributable to ambient PM

   and recorded PM pollution data for 2018 were used for assessing the
   health impacts and possible gains. Calculations were performed with WHO

   country-legal values and WHO air quality recommendations. Ambient PM2.5
   pollution is responsible for 16.20\% and 22.77\% of all-cause mortality
   among adults in Tuzla and Lukavac, respectively. Our data show that life
   expectancy could increase by 2.1 and 2.4 years for those cities. In the
   pollution hotspots, in reality, there is a wide gap in what is observed
   and the implementation of the legally binding air quality limit values
   and, thus, adverse health effects. Considerable health gains and life
   expectancy are possible if legal or health scenarios in polluted cities
   were achieved. This estimate might be useful in providing additional
   health burden evidence as a key component for a clean air policy and
   action plans.},

Abstract = {The process for introducing and developing a program for teaching
   medical professionalism at the National University of Singapore, School
   of Medicine is outlined. Professionalism was recognised as embracing
   `honesty and integrity,' `responsibility and participation,' `respect
   and sensitivity,' and `compassion and empathy.' Those broad values are
   expressed as specific attitudes and behaviours that are taught and
   assessed throughout the course. Honesty and integrity, for example, are
   demonstrated by `presenting original, authentic assignments' (in medical
   education); and `accepting personal mistakes and honestly acknowledging
   them' (in clinical training and practice). Values and items of behaviour
   were drawn from the literature, and reviewed and refined to address
   needs identified within the Medical School. A broad spectrum of
   pre-clinical and clinical teachers contributed to this development. The
   program was reassessed to determine the extent to which it has been
   implemented and has evolved following its adoption. The results are
   confirming in that: the majority of recommendations have been
   implemented; the program has developed further; and is supported by
   ancillary student enrichment activities. Medical professionalism has
   been given prominence through all phases of the course. Nevertheless,
   challenges remain and particularly in the extent to which medical
   professionalism is taught and assessed in various clinical postings.},

Title = {Years of life lost due to lower extremity injury in association with
   dementia, and care need: a 6-year follow-up population-based study using
   a multi-state approach among German elderly},
Journal = {BMC GERIATRICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {Background: Dementia and care need are challenging aging populations
   worldwide. Lower extremity injury (LEI) in the elderly makes matters
   worse. Using a multi-state approach, we express the effect of LEI on
   dementia, care need, and mortality in terms of remaining life expectancy
   at age 75 (rLE) and years of life lost (YLL).
   Methods: A population-based random sample of beneficiaries aged 75-95
   years was drawn from the largest public health insurer in Germany in
   2004 and followed until 2010 (N 62,103; Mean Age +/- SD 81.5 +/- 4.8
   years; Female 71.2 \%). We defined a five-state model (Healthy,
   Dementia, Care, Dementia \& Care, Dead), and calculated
   transition-specific hazard ratios of LEI using Cox regression. The
   transition probabilities as well as the YLL due to LEI were estimated.
   Results: LEI significantly increased the risk for each transition, with
   a maximum risk for the transition from Healthy to Care (HR: 1.70, 95 \%
   CI: 1.63-1.77) and a minimum risk for the transition from Care to Dead
   (HR: 1.16, 95 \% CI: 1.10-1.22). If the elderly had LEI-history, their
   age-specific mortality was generally higher and their probabilities of
   transient states peaked at younger ages. At age 75, initially
   dementia-free and care-independent elderly experiencing LEI lost about 2
   years of life, of which more than 90 \% were life years free of dementia
   or care need. Dementia patients lost about one and a half year, more
   than 60 \% were free of long-term care need.
   Conclusions: LEI not only casts a large health burden on care need, but
   is also associated with cognitive decline and shortened rLE. LEI plus
   dementia extend the relative life time in need of care, despite
   generally shortening rLE. Using the composite measure YLL may help to
   better convey these results to the elderly, families, and health
   professionals. This may strengthen preventive measures as well as
   improve timely and rehabilitative treatment of LEI, not only in
   cognitive and physically intact elderly.},

Abstract = {The State of Kuwait oil fires and military operations associated with
   the 1991 Gulf War resulted in substantially increased levels of airborne
   particulate matter (PM) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) during 1991
   and 1992. Using quantitative risk assessment methodology, this article
   estimates the increase in premature deaths in citizens of the KSA
   associated with the Gulf War-related increase in PM air pollution
   levels. Meta-analysis of daily time-series studies of non-accidental
   mortality associated with increased PM(10) levels using two alternative
   methodologies yielded exposure-response relative risk functions of 2.7\%
   and 3.5\% per 50 mu g/m(3) increase in PM(10) concentration. Combining
   these exposure-response functions with estimates of the magnitude and
   duration of the increased PM(10) exposure, the size of the exposed
   population and baseline mortality rates provided an estimate of
   approximately 1,080 to 1,370 excess non-accidental deaths of Saudi
   citizens during 1991-1992 associated with the Gulf War-related increase
   in PM levels.},

Title = {Short-term impacts of 2017 western North American wildfires on
   meteorology, the atmosphere's energy budget, and premature mortality},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Western North American fires have been increasing in magnitude and
   severity over the last few decades. The complex coupling of fires with
   the atmospheric energy budget and meteorology creates short-term
   feedbacks on regional weather altering the amount of pollution to which
   Americans are exposed. Using a combination of model simulations and
   observations, this study shows that the severe fires in the summer of
   2017 increased atmospheric aerosol concentrations leading to a cooling
   of the air at the surface, reductions in sensible heat fluxes, and a
   lowering of the planetary boundary layer height over land. This
   combination of lower-boundary layer height and increased aerosol
   pollution from the fires reduces air quality. We estimate that from
   start of August to end of October 2017, similar to 400 premature deaths
   occurred within the western US as a result of short-term exposure to
   elevated PM2.5 from fire smoke. As North America confronts a warming
   climate with more fires the short-term climate and pollution impacts of
   increased fire activity should be assessed within policy aimed to
   minimize impacts of climate change on society.},

Title = {Trends in premature mortality in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
   probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years},

Abstract = {Background: The burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is a major
   challenge facing the whole world. Around 15 million premature deaths due
   to NCDs occur in people aged 30-70 years annually.
   Aims: Mortality data based on death registration systems and population
   data were used to estimate proposed mortality statistics in the Islamic
   Republic of Iran.
   Methods: Various criteria and methods were used to assess the quality of
   mortality data. The probability of dying among those aged 30-70 years
   for all causes and for NCDs was calculated using the life table method.
   Results: The mortality rate in the population aged 30-69 years was
   343.12 (per 100 000 persons) in 2006 and decreased to 240.62 in 2016 in
   both sexes. The probability of dying due to NCDs was 21.36\% in 2006 and
   declined to 14.95\% in 2016 for both sexes.
   Conclusions: The number of premature deaths due to NCDs have decreased
   over the last decade. We predict that this reduction will continue and
   the country will meet the targets of the WHO NCD action plan by 2025 and
   also the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals for reducing
   premature deaths by 2030. However, the morbidity and burden of NCDs are
   still public health concerns in the country. Due to advancements in
   health care technologies and also the aging population, these concerns
   will impose greater costs on the health system. Hence, prevention
   programmes for NCDs should be an urgent priority for Iranian health
   policy.},

Title = {Projection of premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases for
   2025: a model based study from Hunan Province, China, 1990-2016},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Background. In 2011, the United Nations set a target to reduce premature
   mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by 25\% by 2025. While
   studies have reported the target in some countries, no studies have been
   done in China. This study aims to project the ability to reach the
   target in Hunan Province, China, and establish the priority for future
   interventions.
   Methods. We conducted the study during 2019-2020. From the Global Burden
   of Disease Study 2016, we extracted death data for Hunan during
   1990-2016 for four main NCDs, namely cancer, cardiovascular disease
   (CVD), chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. We generated
   estimates for 2025 by fitting a linear regression to the premature
   mortality over the most recent trend identified by a joinpoint
   regression model. We also estimated excess premature mortality
   attributable to unfavorable changes over time.
   Results. The rate of premature mortality from all NCDs in Hunan will be
   19.5\% (95\% CI {[}19.0\%-20.1\%]) by 2025, with the main contributions
   being from CVD (8.2\%, 95\% CI {[}7.9\%-8.5\%]) and cancer (7.9\%, 95\%
   CI {[}7.8\%-8.1\%]). Overall, it will be impossible to achieve the
   target, with a relative reduction of 16.4\%. Women may be able to meet
   the target except with respect to cancer, and men will not except with
   respect to chronic respiratory diseases. Most of the unfavorable changes
   have occurred since 2008-2009.
   Discussion. More urgent efforts, especially for men, should be exerted
   in Hunan by integrating population-wide interventions into a stronger
   health-care system. In the post lock-down COVID-19 era in China,
   reducing the NCD risk factors can also lower the risk of death from
   COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Stem cell transplantation has been used for many years to
   treat haematological malig-nancies that could not be cured by other
   treatments. Despite this medical breakthrough, mortality rates remain
   high. Our purpose was to evaluate labour productivity losses associated
   with premature mortality due to blood cancer in recipients of stem cell
   transplantations.
   Methods: We collected primary data from the clinical histories of blood
   cancer patients who had undergone stem cell transplantation between 2006
   and 2011 in two Spanish hospitals. We carried out a descriptive analysis
   and calculated the years of potential life lost and years of potential
   productive life lost. Labour productivity losses due to premature
   mortality were estimated using the Human Capital method. An alternative
   approach, the Friction Cost method, was used as part of the sensitivity
   analysis.
   Results: Our findings suggest that, in a population of 179 transplanted
   and deceased patients, males and people who die between the ages of 30
   and 49 years generate higher labour productivity losses. The estimated
   loss amounts to over (sic)31.4 million using the Human Capital method
   ((sic) 480,152 using the Friction Cost method), which means an average
   of (sic)185,855 per death. The highest labour productivity losses are
   produced by leukaemia. However, lymphoma generates the highest loss per
   death.
   Conclusions: Further efforts are needed to reduce premature mortality in
   blood cancer patients undergoing transplantations and reduce economic
   losses. (C) 2014 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights

Title = {Job Losses and Accumulated Number of Broken Partnerships Increase Risk
   of Premature Mortality in Danish Men Born in 1953},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective: To investigate how accumulation of job losses and broken
   partnerships affect the risk of premature mortality, and to study joint
   exposure to both events. Methods: Birth cohort study of 9789 Danish men
   born in 1953 with follow-up of events between the ages of 40 and 5.1.
   Results: The adjusted hazard rates for premature mortality was 1.44
   (95\% CI = 1.15 to 1.80) for individuals with one job loss, 1.55 (1.13
   to 2.13) for individuals with one broken partnership, and 2.15 (95 \% CI
   = 1.49 to 3.10) for individuals with two or more broken partnerships.
   Conclusions: Experience of at least one job loss increased the risk of
   premature mortality. The risk of Premature mortality increased with the
   number of broken partnerships. There was no statistical interaction
   between job losses and broken partnerships. (J Occup Environ Med.

Title = {Effects of covid-19 pandemic on life expectancy and premature mortality
   in 2020: time series analysis in 37 countries},
Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {375},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the changes in life expectancy and years of life
   lost in 2020 associated with the covid-19 pandemic. DESIGN Time series
   analysis. SETTING 37 upper-middle and high income countries or regions
   with reliable and complete mortality data. PARTICIPANTS Annual all cause
   mortality data from the Human Mortality Database for 2005-20, harmonised
   and disaggregated by age and sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Reduction in
   life expectancy was estimated as the difference between observed and
   expected life expectancy in 2020 using the Lee-Carter model. Excess
   years of life lost were estimated as the difference between the observed
   and expected years of life lost in 2020 using the World Health
   Organization standard life table. RESULTS Reduction in life expectancy
   in men and women was observed in all the countries studied except New
   Zealand, Taiwan, and Norway, where there was a gain in life expectancy
   in 2020. No evidence was found of a change in life expectancy in
   Denmark, Iceland, and South Korea. The highest reduction in life
   expectancy was observed in Russia (men: -2.33, 95\% confidence interval
   -2.50 to -2.17; women: -2.14, -2.25 to - 2.03), the United States (men:
   -2.27, -2.39 to - 2.15; women: -1.61, -1.70 to -1.51), Bulgaria (men:
   -1.96, -2.11 to -1.81; women: -1.37, -1.74 to -1.01), Lithuania (men:
   -1.83, -2.07 to -1.59; women: -1.21, -1.36 to -1.05), Chile (men: -1.64,
   - 1.97 to -1.32; women: -0.88, -1.28 to -0.50), and Spain (men: -1.35,
   -1.53 to -1.18; women: -1.13, - 1.37 to -0.90). Years of life lost in
   2020 were higher than expected in all countries except Taiwan, New
   Zealand, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and South Korea. In the remaining 31
   countries, more than 222 million years of life were lost in 2020, which
   is 28.1 million (95\% confidence interval 26.8m to 29.5m) years of life
   lost more than expected (17.3 million (16.8m to 17.8m) in men and 10.8
   million (10.4m to 11.3m) in women). The highest excess years of life
   lost per 100 000 population were observed in Bulgaria (men: 7260, 95\%
   confidence interval 6820 to 7710; women: 3730, 2740 to 4730), Russia
   (men: 7020, 6550 to 7480; women: 4760, 4530 to 4990), Lithuania (men:
   5430, 4750 to 6070; women: 2640, 2310 to 2980), the US (men: 4350, 4170
   to 4530; women: 2430, 2320 to 2550), Poland (men: 3830, 3540 to 4120;
   women: 1830, 1630 to 2040), and Hungary (men: 2770, 2490 to 3040; women:
   1920, 1590 to 2240). The excess years of life lost were relatively low
   in people younger than 65 years, except in Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania,
   and the US where the excess years of life lost was >2000 per 100 000.
   CONCLUSION More than 28 million excess years of life were lost in 2020
   in 31 countries, with a higher rate in men than women. Excess years of
   life lost associated with the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 were more than
   five times higher than those associated with the seasonal influenza
   epidemic in 2015.},

Title = {Ablation of insulin-producing cells prevents obesity but not premature

Abstract = {Ageing can be modulated by genetic as well as nutritional interventions.
   In female Drosophila melanogaster, lifespan is maximized at intermediate
   concentrations of sucrose as the carbohydrate source, and yeast as the
   protein source. Dampening the signal through the insulin/IGF signalling
   (IIS) pathway, by genetic ablation of median neurosecretory cells
   (mNSCs) that produce insulin-like peptides, extends lifespan and
   counteracts the detrimental effects of excess yeast. However, how IIS
   reduction impacts health on a high-sugar diet remains unclear. We find
   that, while the ablation of them NSCs can extend lifespan and delay the
   age-related decline in the health of the neuromuscular system
   irrespective of the amount of dietary sugar, it cannot rescue the
   lifespan-shortening effects of excess sugar. On the other hand, ablation
   of mNSCs can prevent adult obesity resulting from excess sugar, and this
   effect appears independent from the canonical effector of IIS, dfoxo.
   Our study indicates that while treatments that reduce IIS have
   anti-ageing effects irrespective of dietary sugar, additional
   interventions may be required to achieve full benefits in humans, where
   excessive sugar consumption is a growing problem. At the same time,
   pathways regulated by IIS may be suitable targets for treatment of
   obesity.},

Title = {Alcohol abstention in early adulthood and premature mortality: Do early
   life factors, social support, and health explain this association?},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {163},
Pages = {71-79},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objective: Adult alcohol abstainers have a heightened risk of premature
   mortality compared to light-to moderate drinkers. We examine three
   plausible explanations, other than lack of alcohol, for this observed
   difference: Abstainers 1) have early life disadvantages that undermine
   long-term health; 2) lack social support; 3) are less healthy.
   Method: In the National Child Development Study, an ongoing national
   British cohort study of individuals born in 1958, we investigated
   whether early life disadvantages, lack of social support, and poor
   physical health reduce or eliminate the elevated risk of mortality
   through age 51 among those abstaining from alcohol at age 33. Using Cox
   proportional hazard models in a stepwise approach we examined whether
   the alcohol-mortality relationship changed when potential confounders
   were included.
   Results: The risk of mortality by age 51 was greater among age-33
   abstainers compared to light drinkers (Hazard Ratio {[}HR] = 2.18; 95\%
   CI = 1.40, 3.40). Including early life disadvantages and social support
   in the hazard models did not alter these associations (HR = 2.12; 95\%
   CI = 1.27, 3.54). Including physical health in the model resulted in a
   25\% reduction in risk of death among abstainers, though the difference
   in risk remained statistically significant (HR = 1.75; 95\% CI = 1.04,
   2.94).
   Conclusions: Abstaining from alcohol in early adulthood, in comparison
   to light drinking, predicts increased risk for premature mortality, even
   after accounting for numerous early and young adult confounders. Future
   research should examine potential moderators of this association. (C)

Title = {Premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 pollution in China during
   2008-2016: Underlying causes and responses to emission reductions},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {263},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) poses a great
   threat to public health in China. To this end, the Chinese government
   promulgated the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (the
   Action Plan) in 2013. However, the health benefits of the Action Plan
   have not been well explained. In this paper, the underlying causes of
   changes in premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 pollution and the
   response of this mitigation policy in China were explored using
   sensitivity analysis. The simulated annual average PM2.5 concentration
   reduced by 24.9\% over mainland China from 2008 to 2016. Subsequently,
   national premature mortality would decrease by 14.4\% from 1.14 million
   (95\% CI: 0.54, 1.55) in 2008 to 0.98 million (95\% CI: 0.44, 1.38) in
   2016. Specifically, premature mortality reduced by 209,600 cases
   (similar to 18.3\%) owing to PM2.5 reduction during 2008-2016, of which
   188,500 cases were from 2014 to 2016 due to the Action Plan in 2013.
   Note that the health benefits were limited when compared with air
   quality improvements, mainly due to that the IER functions have a stable
   curve at higher concentration intervals. Meanwhile, premature mortality
   would have increased by 14.2\% from 2008 to 2016 owing to demographic
   changes, substantially weakening the impact of the decrease in PM2.5 and
   baseline mortality. The effectiveness of China's new air pollution
   mitigation policy was proved through the research. However, considering
   the non-linear response of mortality to PM2.5 changes and the
   aggravation of demography trends, stronger emission control steps should
   be further taken to protect public health in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Jim Crow and Premature Mortality Among the US Black and White
   Population, 1960-2009 An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Scant research has analyzed the health impact of abolition
   of Jim Crow (ie, legal racial discrimination overturned by the US 1964
   Civil Rights Act).
   Methods: We used hierarchical age-period-cohort models to analyze US
   national black and white premature mortality rates (death before 65
   years of age) in 1960-2009.
   Results: Within a context of declining US black and white premature
   mortality rates and a persistent 2-fold excess black risk of premature
   mortality in both the Jim Crow and non-Jim Crow states, analyses
   including random period, cohort, state, and county effects and fixed
   county income effects found that, within the black population, the
   largest Jim Crow-by-period interaction occurred in 1960-1964 (mortality
   rate ratio {[}MRR] = 1.15 {[}95\% confidence interval = 1.09-1.22),
   yielding the largest overall period-specific Jim Crow effect MRR of
   1.27, with no such interactions subsequently observed. Furthermore, the
   most elevated Jim Crow-by-cohort effects occurred for birth cohorts from
   1901 through 1945 (MRR range = 1.05-1.11), translating to the largest
   overall cohort-specific Jim Crow effect MRRs for the 1921-1945 birth
   cohorts (MRR similar to 1.2), with no such interactions subsequently
   observed. No such interactions between Jim Crow and either period or
   cohort occurred among the white population.
   Conclusion: Together, the study results offer compelling evidence of the
   enduring impact of both Jim Crow and its abolition on premature
   mortality among the US black population, although insufficient to
   eliminate the persistent 2-fold black excess risk evident in both the
   Jim Crow and non-Jim Crow states from 1960 to 2009.},

Title = {Estimating premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure and
   benefit of air pollution control policies in China for 2020},

Abstract = {In past decade of rapid industrial development and urbanization, China
   has witnessed increasingly persistent severe haze and smog episodes,
   posing serious health hazards to the Chinese population, especially in
   densely populated cities. Quantification of health impacts attributable
   to PM2.5 (particulates with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) has
   important policy implications to tackle air pollution. The Chinese
   national monitoring network has recently included direct measurements of
   ground level PM2.5, providing a potentially more reliable source for
   exposure assessment. This study reports PM2.5-related long-term
   mortality of year 2015 in 161 cities of nine regions across China using
   integrated exposure risk (IER) model for PM2.5 exposure-response
   functions (ERF). It further provides an estimate of the potential health
   benefits by year 2020 with a realization of the goals of Air Pollution
   Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) and the three interim
   targets (ITs) and Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) for PM2.5 by the World
   Health Organization (WHO). PM2.5-related premature mortality in 161
   cities was 652 thousand, about 6.92\% of total deaths in China during
   year 2015. Among all premature deaths, contributions of cerebrovascular
   disease (stroke), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer (LC) and acute lower respiratory
   infections (ALRIs) were 51.70, 26.26, 11.77, 9.45 and 0.82\%,
   respectively. The premature mortality in densely populated cities is
   very high, such as Tianjin (12,533/year), Beijing (18,817/year), Baoding
   (10,932/year), Shanghai (18,679/year), Chongqing (23,561/year), Chengdu
   (11,809/year), Harbin (9037/year) and Linyi (9141/year). The potential
   health benefits will be 4.4, 16.2, 34.5, 63.6 and 81.5\% of the total
   present premature mortality when PM2.5 concentrations in China meet the
   APPCAP, WHO IT-1, IT-2, IT-3 and AQG respectively, by the year 2020. In
   the current situation, by the end of year 2030, even if Chines
   government fulfills its own target to meet national ambient air quality
   standard of PM2.5 (35 mu g/m(3)), total premature mortality attributable
   to PM2.5 will be 574 thousand across 161 cities. The present methodology
   will greatly help policy makers and pollution control authorities to
   further analyze cost and benefits of air pollution management programs
   in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Countries around the world introduced strict restrictions on movement
   and activities known as `lockdowns' to restrict the spread of the novel
   coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the end of 2019. A sudden
   improvement in air quality was observed globally as a result of these
   lockdowns. To provide insight into the changes in air pollution levels
   in response to the COVID-19 restrictions we have compared surface air
   quality data in Delhi during four phases of lockdown and the first phase
   of the restriction easing period (25 March to 30 June 2020) with data
   from a baseline period (2018-2019). Simultaneously, short-term exposure
   of PM2.5 and O-3 attributed premature mortality were calculated to
   understand the health benefit of the change in air quality. Ground-level
   observations in Delhi showed that concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2
   dropped substantially in 2020 during the overall study period compared
   with the same period in previous years, with average reductions of
   similar to 49\%, similar to 39\%, and similar to 39\%, respectively. An
   overall lower reduction in O-3 of similar to 19\% was observed for
   Delhi. A slight increase in O-3 was found in Delhi's industrial and
   traffic regions. The highest peak of the diurnal variation decreased
   substantially for all the pollutants at every phase. The decrease in
   PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations in 2020, prevented 904 total premature
   deaths, a 60\% improvement when compared to the figures for 2018-2019.
   The restrictions on human activities during the lockdown have reduced
   anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality and human
   health in one of the most polluted cities in the world.
   Implications: I am submitting herewith the manuscript entitled
   ``Unprecedented Reduction in Air Pollution and Corresponding Short-term
   Premature Mortality Associated with COVID-19 Forced Confinement in
   Delhi, India{''} for potential publishing in your journal.
   The novelty of this research lies in: (1) we utilized ground-level air
   quality data in Delhi during four phases of lockdown and the first phase
   of unlocking period (25(th) March to 30(th) June) for 2020 as well as
   data from the baseline period (2018-2019) to provide an early insight
   into the changes in air pollution levels in response to the COVID-19
   pandemic, (2) Chatarize the change of diurnal variation of the
   pollutants and (3) we assess the health risk due to PM2.5 and O-3.
   Results from ground-level observations in Delhi showed that
   concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 substantially dropped in 2020
   during the overall study period compared to the similar period in
   previous years, with an average reduction of similar to 49\%, similar to
   39\%, and similar to 39\%, respectively. In the case of O-3, the overall
   reduction was observed as similar to 19\% in Delhi, while a slight
   increase was found in industrial and traffic regions. And consequently,
   the highest peak of the diurnal variation decreased substantially for
   all the pollutants. The health impact assessment of the changes in air
   quality indicated that 904 short-term premature deaths (similar to 60\%)
   were prevented due to the decline in PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations in the
   study period. The restrictions on human activities during the lockdown
   have reduced the anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air
   quality and human health in one of the most polluted cities in the
   world.},

Abstract = {Racial and socioeconomic inequalities in health are consistently
   reported, but less is known about the interplay between racial and
   deprivation -related inequities. We used geographically -localized data
   on all deaths recorded in Washington state 2011 to 2015 (n 1 / 4 242,667
   decedents) and multi -level regression models to examine pre- mature (
   <65 years) mortality by race and neighborhood deprivation separately and
   in combination. White versus non-white inequities in premature mortality
   did not vary substantially with increasing levels of depri- vation.
   However, most non-white races from deprived neighborhoods had odds of
   premature mortality between three and eight times that of more -affluent
   whites. These findings may reflect the compounding of disadvantage
   stemming from social and environmental risk factors.},

Title = {Premature mortality after suicide attempt in relation to living
   arrangements. A register-based study in Finland in 1988-2007},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-79},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Background: Several studies have shown that individuals with a history
   of suicide attempt form a high-risk mortality group. Completed suicide
   is the main cause of death among them, but excess mortality for other
   causes of death is much less studied. Furthermore, little is known
   whether living with others modifies the excess risk of mortality among
   suicide attempters. Methods: We evaluated an 11\% sample from the
   population registration data of Finns aged 15 years and older in the
   period 1988-2007 with an 80\% oversample of death records and a linkage
   with information on causes of hospitalisation. We estimate standardised
   mortality rates and Poisson regression models separately for the general
   population and those treated in hospital for suicide attempt. Results:
   Compared with the general population, all-cause mortality risk was
   similar to 10-fold among women and well over 10-fold among men during
   the first 3 months following suicide attempt. The risk for suicide was
   even greater, but in addition to external causes of death, mortality
   from smoking-and alcohol-related diseases was elevated. Instead, the
   proportion of alcohol-associated suicides was smaller among the suicide
   attempters. Among suicide attempters, the association between living
   arrangements and mortality was much weaker than in the general
   population. Conclusion: Premature mortality is extremely high after
   suicide attempt, especially in the first year. Our results do not
   support the idea that the resources provided by living with others
   ameliorate the effects of suicide attempt on subsequent mortality.
   Suicide prevention should focus on designing adequate aftercare
   following the attempt, especially for those with alcohol problems.},

Abstract = {To tackle the severe fine particle (PM2.5) pollution in China, the
   government has implemented stringent control policies mainly on power
   plants, industry, and transportation since 2005, but estimates of the
   effectiveness of the policy and the temporal trends in health impacts
   are subject to large uncertainties. By adopting an integrated approach
   that combines chemical transport simulation, ambient/household exposure
   evaluation, and health-impact assessment, we find that the integrated
   population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 (IPWE) decreased by 47\% (95\%
   confidence interval, 37-55\%) from 2005 {[}180 (146-219) mu g/m(3)] to
   2015 {[}96 (83-111) mu g/m(3)]. Unexpectedly, 90\% (86-93\%) of such
   reduction is attributed to reduced household solid-fuel use, primarily
   resulting from rapid urbanization and improved incomes rather than
   specific control policies. The IPWE due to household fuels for both
   cooking and heating decreased, but the impact of cooking is
   significantly larger. The reduced household-related IPWE is estimated to
   avoid 0.40 (0.25-0.57) million premature deaths annually, accounting for
   33\% of the PM2.5-induced mortality in 2015. The IPWE would be further
   reduced by 63\% (57-68\%) if the remaining household solid fuels were
   replaced by clean fuels, which would avoid an additional 0.51
   (0.40-0.64) million premature deaths. Such a transition to clean fuels,
   especially for heating, requires technology innovation and policy
   support to overcome the barriers of high cost of distribution systems,
   as is recently being attempted in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. We
   suggest that household-fuel use be more highly prioritized in national
   control policies, considering its effects on PM2.5 exposures.},

Title = {Huntingtons Disease Mice Infected with Toxoplasma gondii Demonstrate
   Early Kynurenine Pathway Activation, Altered CD8+T-Cell Responses, and
   Premature Mortality},

Abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
   caused by a polyglutamine-repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein.
   Activation of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation is
   implicated in the pathogenesis of HD. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)
   catalyzes the oxidation of tryptophan to kynurenine, the first step in
   this pathway. The prevalent, neuroinvasive protozoal pathogen To
   xoplasma gondii (T. gondii) results in clinically silent life-long
   infection in immune-competent individuals. T. gondii infection results
   in activation of IDO which provides some protection against the parasite
   by depleting tryptophan which the parasite cannot synthesize. The
   kynurenine pathway may therefore represent a point of synergism between
   HD and T. gondii infection. We show here that IDO activity is elevated
   at least four-fold in frontal cortex and striata of non-infected
   N171-82Q HD mice at 14-weeks corresponding to early-advanced HD. T.
   gondii infection at 5 weeks resulted in elevation of cortical IDO
   activity in HD mice. HD-infected mice died significantly earlier than
   wild-type infected and HD control mice. Prior to death, infected HD mice
   demonstrated decreased CD8+ T-lymphocyte proliferation in brain and
   spleen compared to wild-type infected mice. We demonstrate for the first
   time that HD mice have an altered response to an infectious agent that
   is characterized by premature mortality, altered immune responses and
   early activation of IDO. Findings are relevant to understanding how T.
   gondii infection may interact with pathways mediating neurodegeneration
   in HD.},

Abstract = {Development of strategies to control urban air pollution is a complex
   and multi-disciplinary process. In most real life cases, relevant policy
   making is characterised by the lack of information related to the
   economic value of the health consequences attributed to air pollution.
   This information is important to possess reliable economic estimates for
   the benefit arising from the application of the proposed strategies.
   This paper presents a contingent valuation approach in order to elicit
   the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reducing the risk of premature
   mortality attributed to air pollution based on an easy-to-comprehend
   questionnaire. The economic value of increasing life expectancy by
   saving one year of life loss through improving air quality is estimated
   for Thessaloniki, Greece, which is considered one of the most polluted
   -if not the most polluted-cities within Europe, especially with respect
   to airborne particles. A sample of approximately 800 residents was
   chosen and a face-to-face interview was conducted using a hypothetical
   open-ended question designed to elicit the respondents WTP. Change in
   life expectancy was well understood and the results showed that 78.2\%
   of respondents were able to express their WTP. The mean WTP to save one
   Year of Life Loss (YOLL) is approximately 920 (sic) per person per year,
   which corresponds to a Value of a Life Year (VOLY) that is approximately
   41 000 (sic). (c) Author(s) 2011. This work is distributed under the

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the relation of scores on tests of mental ability
   across childhood with established risk factors for premature mortality
   at the age of 30 years.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study based on members of the British
   Cohort Study born in Great Britain in 1970 who had complete data on IQ
   scores at five ( N = 8203) or 10 ( N = 8171) years of age and risk
   factors at age 30 years.
   Results: In sex- adjusted analyses, higher IQ score at age 10 years was
   associated with a reduced prevalence of current smoking ( ORper 1 SD
   advantage in IQ 0.84; 95\% CI 0.80, 0.88), overweight ( 0.88; 0.84,
   0.92), obesity ( 0.84; 0.79, 0.92), and hypertension ( 0.90; 0.83,
   0.98), and an increased likelihood of having given up smoking by the age
   of 30 years ( 1.25; 1.18, 1.24). These gradients were attenuated after
   adjustment for markers of socioeconomic circumstances across the life
   course, particularly education. There was no apparent relationship
   between IQ and diabetes. Essentially the same pattern of association was
   evident when the predictive value of IQ scores at five years of age was
   examined.
   Conclusions: The mental ability - risk factor gradients reported in the
   present study may offer some insights into the apparent link between low
   pre- adult mental ability and premature mortality.},

Title = {Combined loss of neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthase causes
   premature mortality and age-related hypertrophic cardiac remodeling in
   mice},

Abstract = {Deficiency of either neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) or
   endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) leads to cardiac hypertrophy in
   mice. Loss of both produces concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling,
   in which increased wall thickness is accompanied by reduced cavity size.
   In humans. this phenotype develops in elderly hypertensive patients and
   independently predicts mortality. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis
   that NOS1/3(-/-) mice have reduced longevity compared to either
   NOS1(-/-) or NOS3(-/-). Survival data on colonies of NOS 1(-/-) (n =
   295), NOS3(-/-) (n = 525), and NOS1/3(-/-) (n = 331) mice were collected
   for 2 years. NOS1(-/-) mice had increased mortality compared to NOS3-/-
   (relative risk, RR 2.5. P < 0.001), whereas NOS 1/3(-/-) fared
   significantly worse (RR 7.3, P < 0.001 vs. NOS3(-/-)). Importantly,
   gender did not affect survival in NOS1(-/-) or NOS3(-/-), but male NOS
   1/3(-/-) mice had 2-fold increased mortality compared to females.
   NOS1/3(-/-) mice developed progressive myocyte hypertrophy and
   interstitial fibrosis with age. NOS 1/3(-/-) mice underwent in vivo
   hemodynamic analysis with a combined pressure-volume catheter to assess
   age-related cardiovascular changes. Compared with control, NOS1/3(-/-)
   demonstrated hypertension and hypercontractility at all ages, and
   developed passive diastolic dysfunction with increasing age. Thus,
   combined deficiency of NOS1 and NOS3 causes increased mortality, myocyte
   hypertrophy, and an age-associated increase in ventricular stiffness.
   These findings suggest that cardiac NO signals may play an essential
   role in successful cardiac aging. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {Prevalence and Premature Mortality Statistics of Autism Spectrum
   Disorder Among Children in Korea: A Nationwide Population-Based Birth
   Cohort Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the 8-year prevalence
   and mortality statistics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) according to
   birth year (2002-2012). Methods: We used the National Health Insurance
   Service database with 4,989,351 children born from 2002 to 2012
   including 35,529 children diagnosed with ASD until 8 years of age. The
   8-year cumulative prevalence of ASD was calculated annually (2010-2020)
   with 8 years of follow-up. The 8-year mortality was estimated using Cox
   models adjusted for sex, household income, area of residence, and year
   of birth. Results: Of the 473,494 children born in 2002, 2,467 (5.2 per
   1,000 births) were diagnosed with ASD until 2010. The ASD prevalence was
   2.6 times higher among boys (1,839; 7.4 per 1,000 boy births) than girls
   (628; 2.8 per 1,000 girl births). Of the 467,360 children born in 2012,
   4,378 (9.4 per 1,000 births) were diagnosed with ASD until 2020. The ASD
   prevalence was 2.7 times higher among boys (3,246; 13.5 per 1,000 boy
   births) than girls (1,132; 5.0 per 1,000 girl births). The risk of
   all-cause mortality was higher among children with ASD than those
   without (hazard ratio {[}HR], 2.340; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   2.063-2.654), which is substantially higher among girls (HR, 4.223; 95\%
   CI, 3.472-5.135) than boys (HR, 1.774; 95\% CI, 1.505-2.090).
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that national-level
   prevalence and mortality statistics of ASD can be estimated effectively
   using claims data comprising newborns born each year and followed up for
   to the age of interest. Because this information is essential to
   establish evidence-based policies, health authorities need to consider
   producing epidemiological information of ASD continuously using the same
   methodology.},

Title = {The Population-Attributable Fraction for Premature Mortality Due to
   Cardiovascular Disease Associated With Stage 1 and 2 Hypertension Among
   Japanese},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-63},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND:
   Our aim was to assess how the population-attributable fraction (PAF) for
   premature mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with
   hypertension changes if blood pressure (BP) thresholds for hypertension
   were lowered from systolic/diastolic BP >= 140/90 mm Hg to >= 130/80 mm
   Hg, as defined using the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American
   Heart Association blood pressure guideline.
   METHODS:
   Analyses were conducted using a database of participants who underwent a
   national health checkup examination started in 2008 in Japan (n =
   510,238; mean age, 59.6 +/- 8.1 years; 42\% men). Each participant was
   categorized as having normal or elevated BP, or stage 1 or 2
   hypertension according to the guideline. Data on premature mortality due
   to CVD occurring before age 70 years were available through March 2015.
   RESULTS:
   Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years, 739 deaths from CVD occurred.
   After multivariable adjustment, hazard ratios for premature CVD
   mortality for elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2
   hypertension vs. normal BP were 1.02 (95\% confidence interval, 0.72,
   1.44), 1.33 (1.02, 1.75), and 2.41 (1.90, 3.05), respectively. The PAF
   associated with stage 1 and 2 hypertension was 4.4\% and 39.4\%,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   In the current nationwide study of Japanese adults, stage 1 and 2
   hypertension were associated with an increased risk for premature CVD
   mortality. The PAF for premature CVD mortality associated with
   hypertension increased by 4.4\% if BP thresholds for hypertension were
   lowered from systolic/diastolic BP >= 140/90 to >= 130/80 mm Hg.},

Abstract = {Background and objective: The last systematic review on the health
   consequences of child and adolescent obesity found little evidence on
   consequences for adult health. The present study aimed to summarize
   evidence on the long-term impact of child and adolescent obesity for
   premature mortality and physical morbidity in adulthood.
   Methods: Systematic review with evidence searched from January 2002 to
   June 2010. Studies were included if they contained a measure of
   overweight and/or obesity between birth and 18 years (exposure measure)
   and premature mortality and physical morbidity (outcome) in adulthood.
   Results: Five eligible studies examined associations between overweight
   and/or obesity, and premature mortality: 4/5 found significantly
   increased risk of premature mortality with child and adolescent
   overweight or obesity. All 11 studies with cardiometabolic morbidity as
   outcomes reported that overweight and obesity were associated with
   significantly increased risk of later cardiometabolic morbidity
   (diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and stroke) in adult
   life, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.1-5.1. Nine studies examined
   associations of child or adolescent overweight and obesity with other
   adult morbidity: studies of cancer morbidity were inconsistent; child
   and adolescent overweight and obesity were associated with significantly
   increased risk of later disability pension, asthma, and polycystic ovary
   syndrome symptoms.
   Conclusions: A relatively large and fairly consistent body of evidence
   now demonstrates that overweight and obesity in childhood and
   adolescence have adverse consequences on premature mortality and
   physical morbidity in adulthood. International Journal of Obesity (2011)

Title = {Factors Associated With County-Level Variation in Premature Mortality
   Due to Noncommunicable Chronic Disease in the United States, 1999-2017},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},

Abstract = {Importance Progress against premature death due to noncommunicable
   chronic disease (NCD) has stagnated. In the United States, county-level
   variation in NCD premature mortality has widened, which has impeded
   progress toward mortality reduction for the World Health Organization
   (WHO) 25 x 25 target. Objectives To estimate variations in county-level
   NCD premature mortality, to investigate factors associated with
   mortality, and to present the progress toward achieving the WHO 25 x 25
   target by analyzing the trends in mortality. Design, Setting, and
   Participants This cross-sectional study focused on NCD premature
   mortality and its factors from 3109 counties using US mortality data for
   cause of death from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
   WONDER databases and county-level characteristics data from multiple
   databases. Data were collected from January 1, 1999, through December
   31, 2017, and analyzed from April 1 through October 28, 2019. Exposures
   County-level factors, including demographic composition, socioeconomic
   features, health care environment, and population health status. Main
   Outcomes and Measures Variations in county-level, age-adjusted NCD
   mortality in the US residents aged 25 to 64 years and associations
   between mortality and the 4 sets of county-level factors. Results A
   total of 6 \& x202f;794 \& x202f;434 deaths due to NCD were recorded
   during the study period (50.58\% women; 16.49\% aged 65 years or older).
   Mortality decreased by 4.30 (95\% CI, -4.54 to -4.08) deaths per 100 \&
   x202f;000 person-years annually from 1999 to 2010 (P < .001) and
   decreased annually at a rate of 0.90 (95\% CI, -1.13 to -0.73) deaths
   per 100 \& x202f;000 person-years annually from 2010 to 2017 (P < .001).
   Mortality in the county with the highest mortality was 10.40 times as
   high as that in the county with the lowest mortality (615.40 vs 59.20
   per 100 \& x202f;000 population) in 2017. Geographic inequality was
   decomposed by between-state and within-state differences, and
   within-state differences accounted for most inequality (57.10\% in
   2017). County-level factors were associated with 71.83\% variation in
   NCD mortality. Association with intercounty mortality was 19.51\% for
   demographic features, 23.34\% for socioeconomic composition, 16.40\% for
   health care environment, and 40.75\% for health-status characteristics.
   Conclusions and Relevance Given the stagnated trend of decline and
   increasing variations in NCD premature mortality, these findings suggest
   that the WHO 25 x 25 target appears to be unattainable, which may be
   related to broad failure by United Nations members to follow through on
   commitments of reducing socioeconomic inequalities. The increasing
   inequalities in mortality are alarming and warrant expanded
   multisectoral efforts to ameliorate socioeconomic disparities.
   This cross-sectional study examines variation in premature mortality due
   to noncommunicable chronic disease (NCD) across counties and
   investigates county-specific factors associated with this mortality
   among US residents aged 25 to 64 years.
   Question How does county-level premature mortality due to
   noncommunicable chronic disease vary by economic and geographic factors
   in the United States? Findings In this cross-sectional study of 3109 US
   counties, the variations in mortality due to noncommunicable chronic
   disease increased from 1999 to 2017, and within-state differences
   accounted for most of the inequalities (57.10\% in 2017). The mortality
   variation was associated with demographic composition, socioeconomic
   features, health care environment, and population health status. Meaning
   The increasing variations in premature mortality due to noncommunicable
   chronic disease suggest a need for expanded efforts across multisectoral
   actions to reduce the differences in socioeconomic characteristics and
   prevalence of noncommunicable chronic disease risk factors.},

Title = {Cost-Benefit Analysis of Reducing Premature Mortality Caused by Exposure
   to Ozone and PM2.5 in East Asia in 2020},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {In this paper, we compared the costs and benefits of reducing premature
   mortality caused by exposure to surface ozone and particulate matter
   with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) in East Asia in 2020. The
   cost of ozone and PM2.5 emission reduction is estimated using the
   Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies
   (GAINS)-China model. The benefit of reducing premature mortality caused
   by exposure to corresponding ozone and PM2.5 emission is valued by the
   value of statistical life (VSL). The costs and benefits are evaluated
   for two emission reduction policies in 2020 with varying stringency in
   China: Case FS (the strict policy implementation case in China) and Case
   FR (the less strict policy implementation case in China). For ozone, the
   emission reduction cost and the benefit of life saving are 33,000 and
   8200, 36,60099,700 and 22,200-60,700 (million int. \$, 2005), for Case
   FS and Case FR, respectively. The corresponding cost and benefit for
   PM2.5 are 3580 and 523, 292,000797,000 and 194,000-530,000 (million int.
   \$, 2005), respectively. In total (ozone and PM2.5), the respective
   values are 36,400 and 8720, 329,000-897,000 and 217,000-591,000 (million
   int. \$, 2005). Owing to these large benefits and also relatively low PM
   control costs, the benefits of controlling PM2.5 surpass control costs
   significantly. The benefit/cost ratio is especially high for PM2.5 for
   both policies and highlight the priority of controlling aerosol
   emissions in East Asia.},

Abstract = {Ambient air pollution from ground-level ozone and fine particulate
   matter (PM2.5) is associated with premature mortality. Future
   concentrations of these air pollutants will be driven by natural and
   anthropogenic emissions and by climate change. Using anthropogenic and
   biomass burning emissions projected in the four Representative
   Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCPs), the ACCMIP ensemble of
   chemistry-climate models simulated future concentrations of ozone and
   PM2.5 at selected decades between 2000 and 2100. We use output from the
   ACCMIP ensemble, together with projections of future population and
   baseline mortality rates, to quantify the human premature mortality
   impacts of future ambient air pollution. Future air-pollution-related
   premature mortality in 2030, 2050 and 2100 is estimated for each
   scenario and for each model using a health impact function based on
   changes in concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 relative to 2000 and
   projected future population and baseline mortality rates. Additionally,
   the global mortality burden of ozone and PM2.5 in 2000 and each future
   period is estimated relative to 1850 concentrations, using present-day
   and future population and baseline mortality rates. The change in future
   ozone concentrations relative to 2000 is associated with excess global
   premature mortality in some scenarios/periods, particularly in RCP8.5 in
   2100 (316 thousand deaths year(-1)), likely driven by the large increase
   in methane emissions and by the net effect of climate change projected
   in this scenario, but it leads to considerable avoided premature
   mortality for the three other RCPs. However, the global mortality burden
   of ozone markedly increases from 382 000 (121 000 to 728 000) deaths
   year(-1) in 2000 to between 1.09 and 2.36 million deaths year(-1) in
   2100, across RCPs, mostly due to the effect of increases in population
   and baseline mortality rates. PM2.5 concentrations decrease relative to
   2000 in all scenarios, due to projected reductions in emissions, and are
   associated with avoided premature mortality, particularly in 2100:
   between -2.39 and -1.31 million deaths year(-1) for the four RCPs. The
   global mortality burden of PM2.5 is estimated to decrease from 1.70
   (1.30 to 2.10) million deaths year 1 in 2000 to between 0.95 and 1.55
   million deaths year 1 in 2100 for the four RCPs due to the combined
   effect of decreases in PM2.5 concentrations and changes in population
   and baseline mortality rates. Trends in future air-pollution-related
   mortality vary regionally across scenarios, reflecting assumptions for
   economic growth and air pollution control specific to each RCP and
   region. Mortality estimates differ among chemistry-climate models due to
   differences in simulated pollutant concentrations, which is the greatest
   contributor to overall mortality uncertainty for most cases assessed
   here, supporting the use of model ensembles to characterize uncertainty.
   Increases in exposed population and baseline mortality rates of
   respiratory diseases magnify the impact on premature mortality of
   changes in future air pollutant concentrations and explain why the
   future global mortality burden of air pollution can exceed the current
   burden, even where air pollutant concentrations decrease.},

Abstract = {Aim: To estimate the burden of premature mortality from major
   cardiovascular diseases among adults in the Republic of Moldova and to
   evaluate National target achieving of 1.5\% annual relative reduction
   from 2013-2020. Material and methods: We conducted a population-based
   study. To assess the premature mortality impact was calculated the
   probability of dying between ages of 30 and 70 from major cardiovascular
   diseases in the Republic of Moldova following adjusted World Health
   Organization's methodology. Results: Along with the mortality chance up
   to the age of 70 years for people at the age of 30 years old because of
   cardiovascular diseases determined to be in decrease trend for the
   period 2003-2015 from 21.2\% to 15.9\% (p<0.001) is find a rising
   percentage change of +3.7\% of unconditional probability of dying from
   cardiovascular disease between ages of 30 and 70 in the Republic of
   Moldova from 2013-2015 instead of planned reduction of -3\%.
   Conclusions: These data can be used to inform development of policies
   that address the observed disparities of national target achieving.},

   global source of PM2.5 emissions and a target for new actions. The
   objective of this study is to estimate the global and national health
   burden of ambient PM2.5 exposure attributable to surface transportation
   emissions. This share of health burden is called the transportation
   attributable fraction (TAF), and is assumed equal to the proportional
   decrease in modeled ambient particulate matter concentrations when
   surface transportation emissions are removed. National
   population-weighted TAFs for 190 countries are modeled for 2005 using
   the MOZART-4 global chemical transport model. Changes in annual average
   concentration of PM2.5 at 0.5 x 0.67 degree horizontal resolution are
   based on a global emissions inventory and removal of all surface
   transportation emissions. Global population-weighted average TAF was 8.5
   percent or 1.75 mu g m(-3) in 2005. Approximately 242 000 annual
   premature deaths were attributable to surface transportation emissions,
   dominated by China, the United States, the European Union and India.
   This application of TAF allows future Global Burden of Disease studies
   to estimate the sector-specific burden of ambient PM2.5 exposure.
   Additional research is needed to capture intraurban variations in
   emissions and exposure, and to broaden the range of health effects
   considered, including the effects of other pollutants.},

Abstract = {Observational studies show that physical activity is strongly associated
   with a reduced risk of premature mortality and major non-communicable
   diseases. We reviewed to which extent these associations have been
   confirmed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the outcomes of
   mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and
   fracture. The results show that exercise does not reduce all-cause
   mortality and incident CVD in older adults or in people with chronic
   conditions, based on RCTs comprising similar to 50,000 participants. The
   results also indicate a lack of effect on cardiovascular mortality in
   people with chronic conditions, based on RCTs comprising similar to
   11,000 participants. Furthermore, there is inconsistent evidence
   regarding the effect of exercise on fractures in older adults, based on
   RCTs comprising similar to 40,000 participants. Finally, based on RCTs
   comprising similar to 17,000 participants, exercise reduces T2D
   incidence in people with prediabetes when combined with dietary
   modification, although evidence for the individual effect of exercise is
   lacking. Identified shortcomings of the current evidence include risks
   of publication bias, lack of high-quality studies in certain high-risk
   populations, and inconstant evidence with respect to some outcomes.
   Thus, additional large trials would be of value, especially with
   fracture as the primary outcome. In conclusion, according to current RCT
   evidence, exercise can prevent T2D assuming it is combined with dietary
   intervention. However, the current evidence shows that exercise does not
   prevent premature mortality or CVD, with inconsistent evidence for
   fractures.},

Abstract = {The prospective association of muscular weakness with the risk of
   all-cause and premature mortality in a general population remains
   unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the prospective
   effects of handgrip strength and muscular weakness on risk for all-cause
   and premature mortality over 10 years using a large nationwide sample of
   Korean adults. The study participants included 9229 middle and older
   adults (4131 males and 5098 females), using data from the Korean
   Longitudinal Study of Ageing 2006-2016. Muscular strength was measured
   using handgrip strength. Muscle weakness was defined using the
   sex-specific handgrip strength index based on the Asian Working Group on
   Sarcopenia in Older People (AWGSOP). The primary outcome was all-cause
   and premature mortality assessed based on the death certificate. The
   hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was negatively associated with
   level of handgrip strength independent of potential confounding factors
   (HR: 2.06, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.62-2.63 for lowest
   quartile vs. highest quartile). When examined using muscle weakness
   defined using the AWGSOP diagnosis, the mortality was 1.56 times higher
   in the weak group (HR: 1.56, 95\% CI: 1.36-1.78). We also found that
   risk of premature mortality was observed in the lowest quartile (HR:
   2.34, 95\% CI: 1.80-3.05) and the muscle weakness group (HR: 1.80, 95\%
   CI: 1.52-2.13) in the fully adjusted model. Our 10-year prospective
   cohort study showed that handgrip strength and muscle weakness are
   strongly associated with an increased risk of all-cause and premature
   mortality in healthy middle-aged and older adults.},

Title = {Years of potential life lost and productivity costs due to premature
   mortality from six priority diseases in Tanzania, 2006-2015},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background
   Mortality statistics are traditionally used to quantify the burden of
   disease and to determine the relative importance of the various causes
   of death. Some of the most frequently used indices to quantify the
   burden of disease are the years of potential life lost (YPLL) and years
   of potential productive life lost (YPPLL). These two measures reflect
   the mortality trends in younger age groups and they provide a more
   accurate picture of premature mortality. This study was carried out to
   determine YPLL, YPPLL and cost of productivity lost (CPL) due to
   premature mortality caused by selected causes of deaths in Tanzania.
   Methods and findings
   Malaria, respiratory diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, cancers and
   injuries were selected for this analysis. The number of deaths by sex
   and age groups were obtained from hospital death registers and ICD-10
   reporting forms in 39 public hospitals in Tanzania, covering a period of
   2006-2015. The life expectancy method and human capital approach were
   used to estimate the YPLL, YPPLL and CPL due to premature mortality.
   During 2006-2015, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, respiratory diseases,
   HIV+tuberculosis, cancer and injury were responsible for a total of
   96,834 hospital deaths, of which 46.4\% (n = 57,508) were among
   individuals in the productive age groups (15-64 years). The reported
   deaths contributed to 2,850,928 YPLL (female = 1,326,724; male =
   1,524,205) with an average of 29 years per death. The average YPLL among
   females (32) was higher than among males (28). Malaria (YPLL = 38 per
   death) accounted for over one-third (35\%) of the total YPLL. There was
   a significant increase in YPLL due to the selected underlying causes of
   death over the 10-year period. Deaths from the selected causes resulted
   into 1,207,499 YPPLL (average = 21 per death). Overall, HIV/AIDS
   contributed to the highest YPPLL (323,704), followed by malaria
   (243,490) and injuries (196,505). While there was a general decrease in
   YPPLL due to malaria, there was an increase of YPPLL due to HIV/AIDS,
   respiratory diseases, cancer and injuries during the 10-year period. The
   total CPL due to the six diseases was US\$ 148,430,009 for 10 years. The
   overall CPL was higher among males than females by 29.1\%. Over half
   (58\%) of the losses were due to deaths among males. HIV/AIDS accounted
   for the largest (29.2\%) CPL followed by malaria (17.8\%) and
   respiratory diseases (14.6\%). The CPL increased from US\$11.4 million
   in 2006 to US\$17.9 million in 2016.
   Conclusions
   The YPLL, YPPLL and CPL due to premature death associated with the six
   diseases in Tanzania are substantially high. While malaria accounted for
   highest YPLL, HIV/AIDS accounted for highest YPPLL and CPL. The overall
   CPL was higher among males than among females. Setting resource
   allocation priorities to malaria, HIV/AIDS and respiratory diseases that
   are responsible for the majority of premature deaths could potentially
   reduce the costs of productivity loss in Tanzania.},

Abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the
   second most common cause of cancer deaths for women. In the present
   study, we examined the trend of premature mortality due to breast cancer
   among Canadian women from 1980 through 2010 and proposed a new measure
   of lifespan shortening. Methods: Mortality data for female breast cancer
   was obtained from the World Health Organization mortality database.
   Years of life lost (YLL) was estimated using Canadian life tables.
   Average lifespan shortened (ALSS) that is calculated and expressed by a
   ratio of YLL relative to expected lifespan. Results: Over this study
   period, age-standardized rates of breast cancer mortality adjusted to
   World Standard Population decreased by 40\% from 23.2 to 14.2 per 100
   000 women. The adjusted YLL rates fell from 5.3 years per 1000 women to
   3.3 years. On average women with breast cancer died 20.8 years prior to
   expected death in 1980 and 18.3 years early in 2010. A novel measure of
   lifespan shortening, the ALSS decreased from one-fourth of the lifespan
   in 1980 to one-fifth in 2010. Conclusions: Our study reports that among
   Canadian women with breast cancer, a smaller proportion of life was lost
   on average at the end of the study period. The ` life lost' measures
   presented in this study would be useful tools to monitor the pattern of
   premature mortality for chronic conditions. These measures gauge the
   effectiveness of the health system with respect to early detection and
   treatment.},

Title = {Age at Death and Linear Enamel Hypoplasias: Testing the Effects of
   Childhood Stress and Adult Socioeconomic Circumstances in Premature
   Mortality},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to test the association between
   linear enamel hypolasias and adult socioeconomic circumstances with age
   at death in a modern skeletal sample of known age. Specifically, this
   study wishes to test whether there is a relationship between early life
   stressors, environmental quality in adult life and premature mortality.
   Methods: The presence/absence of LEH and the number of LEH episodes were
   recorded in 113 adult males from the Lisbon identified skeletal
   collection. The association between LEH and age was quantified using
   linear regression and binary logistic regression models, calculating
   crude and adjusted linear regression coefficients and odds ratios. The
   models were adjusted for year of birth, socioeconomic and migration
   status, and cause of death.
   Results: The presence and number of LEH were related to premature
   mortality. Individuals expressing at least one enamel defect survived
   9.0 years less or were 2.5 times more likely to die before 53 years of
   age compared to individuals with no LEH. However, when controlling for
   the confounding factors considered, the association between LEH and age
   became nonsignificant.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that although early life stressors,
   identified as LEH, seem strongly associated with premature mortality,
   adulthood socioeconomic circumstances accounts for most of the decreased
   longevity. This suggests that either macroscopically identified LEH in
   the permanent canine do not measure stressors early in life, or that a
   cumulative adversity model is a more adequate explanation. (C) 2014

Title = {Estimating alcohol-related premature mortality in san francisco: use of
   population-attributable fractions from the global burden of disease
   study},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Background: In recent years, national and global mortality data have
   been characterized in terms of well-established risk factors. In this
   regard, alcohol consumption has been called the third leading ``actual
   cause of death{''} (modifiable behavioral risk factor) in the United
   States, after tobacco use and the combination of poor diet and physical
   inactivity. Globally and in various regions of the world, alcohol use
   has been established as a leading contributor to the overall burden of
   disease and as a major determinant of health disparities, but, to our
   knowledge, no one has characterized alcohol-related harm in such broad
   terms at the local level. We asked how alcohol-related premature
   mortality in San Francisco, measured in years of life lost (YLLs),
   compares with other well-known causes of premature mortality, such as
   ischemic heart disease or HIV/AIDS.
   Methods: We applied sex-and cause-specific population-attributable
   fractions (PAFs) of years of life lost (YLLs) from the Global Burden of
   Disease Study to 17 comparable outcomes among San Francisco males and
   females during 2004-2007. We did this in three ways: Method 1 assumed
   that all San Franciscans drink like populations in developed economies.
   These estimates were limited to alcohol-related harm. Method 2 modified
   these estimates by including several beneficial effects. Method 3
   assumed that Latino and Asian San Franciscans drink alcohol like
   populations in the global regions related to their ethnicity.
   Results: By any of these three methods, alcohol-related premature
   mortality accounts for roughly a tenth of all YLLs among males.
   Alcohol-related YLLs among males are comparable to YLLs for leading
   causes such as ischemic heart disease and HIV/AIDS, in some instances
   exceeding them. Latino and black males bear a disproportionate burden of
   harm. Among females, for whom estimates differed more by method and were
   smaller than those for males, alcohol-related YLLs are comparable to
   leading causes which rank somewhere between fifth and fourteenth.
   Conclusions: Alcohol consumption is a major contributor to premature
   mortality in San Francisco, especially among males. Interventions to
   avert alcohol-related harm in San Francisco should be taken at the
   population level and deserve the same attention that is given to other
   major risk factors, such as smoking or obesity.},

Abstract = {Background Cancer is annually responsible for millions of deaths in
   Europe and billions of euros in productivity losses; the estimated
   mortality rate of lymphoma was of 7.07 per 100,000 individuals in Spain
   in 2018. This study aimed to evaluate the burden that lymphoma mortality
   represents for the Spanish society. Methods The human capital approach
   was used to estimate the costs derived from premature mortality due to
   lymphoma between 2008 and 2017. Results The number of deaths
   attributable to lymphoma increased steadily over the study period; the
   major number of deaths occurred among males aged 80 to 84 years. During
   the study period, 97,069 years of productive life were lost, a parameter
   that decreased noticeably over time due to the reduction in the number
   of deaths at working age. Productivity losses decreased accordingly.
   Lymphoma represented the 45.36\% of losses due to hematological
   malignancies, generating euro121 million in losses the year 2017.
   Hodgkin lymphoma was, among hematological malignancies, the malignancy
   accounting for the highest portion of losses per individual. Conclusions
   Lymphoma represents a significant burden that can be reduced with the
   implementation of improved diagnosis and treatment methods, which must
   be taken into account in resource allocation and management policies.},

Title = {Association of Early-Life Mental Health With Biomarkers in Midlife and
   Premature Mortality Evidence From the 1958 British Birth Cohort},

Abstract = {This cohort study investigates the association between early-life mental
   health trajectories with biomarkers in midlife and premature mortality.
   Question Is early-life mental health associated with biomarkers in
   midlife and premature mortality? Findings In a birth cohort study of
   17415 participants, early-life mental health was associated with less
   favorable levels of biomarkers 28 years later and elevated risk of
   premature mortality. The associations with biomarkers in midlife were
   more commonly seen in female individuals. Meaning These findings, if
   causal and generalizable to younger cohorts, may have implications for
   overall population health and age-related disease as effective
   interventions on early-life mental health have the potential to shift
   the distribution of risk and improve population health.
   Importance Early-life mental health is known to be associated with
   socioeconomic adversity and psychological distress in adulthood, but
   less is known about potential associations with biomarkers and
   mortality. Objective To investigate the association between early-life
   mental health trajectories with biomarkers in midlife and premature
   mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants This study used data from
   the British National Child Development Study, a population-based birth
   cohort. The initial sample of 17415 individuals consisted of all infants
   born in Great Britain in a single week in 1958. Analysis began Feburary
   2017 and ended May 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Biomarkers collected
   at age 44 to 45 years were fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, glycated
   hemoglobin, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, forced
   expiratory volume, blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio. Information
   on all-cause mortality was available up to age 58 years and
   cause-specific mortality up to age 50 years. Results Biomarkers were
   analyzed from 9377 participants (age, 44-45 years, 4712 female
   {[}50.3\%]) and mortality data from 15067 participants (age, 58 years;
   7379 female {[}49.0\%]). A 4-group longitudinal typology of early-life
   conduct problems and affective symptoms was identified: (1) stable low,
   (2) teacher-identified adolescent onset, (3) moderate, and (4) stable
   high. Compared with the stable-low group, the stable-high (B, 2.308;
   95\% CI, 0.213-4.404) and teacher-identified adolescent-onset (B, 2.114;
   95\% CI, 0.725-3.503) groups had less favorable levels of fibrinogen in
   middle age. Effect modification was observed by sex (P < .005) such that
   compared with the stable-low group, differences in high-density
   lipoprotein and abdominal obesity were only observed in female
   individuals. The stable-high and teacher-identified adolescent-onset
   groups had elevated risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.878;
   95\% CI, 1.501-2.350 and hazard ratio, 1.412; 95\% CI, 1.174-1.698).
   Psychopathology-associated mortality was higher in both groups but
   unintentional injuries-associated mortality only in the stable-high
   group. Conclusions and Relevance Experiencing affective symptoms and
   conduct problems in childhood and adolescence is associated with less
   favorable levels of biomarkers 28 years later and elevated risk of
   premature mortality. These findings, if causal and generalizable to
   younger cohorts, may imply that effective interventions on early-life
   mental health have the potential to shift the distribution of risk and
   improve population health.},

Title = {Effect of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene mutations on

Abstract = {Estimation of mortality and the natural course of a disease is usually
   based on information of carefully studied individuals with or at risk
   for a specific disease. Genealogical information has rarely been
   accurate enough for such studies.
   With the help of church records and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1
   (MEN1) family information of the two founder MEN1 mutations in Northern
   Finland (1466del12 and 1657insC), we could trace back common ancestors
   born in the beginning of the 1700s (1466del12) and approximately 1850
   (1657insC) and find 67 probable gene carriers born between 1728 and
   1929, which were identified among their offspring. Information was
   gathered from 34 obligatory MEN1 gene carriers and 31 spouses. The mean
   age (+/-SD) of death of affected males (n=16) was 61.1+/-12.0 yr vs.
   65.8+/-15.3 yr for unaffected males (n=16) and for affected females
   (n=16) was 67.2+/-10.7 yr vs. 67.7+/-14.7 yr for unaffected females
   (n=13). The ages of death of the obligatory heterozygotes did not differ
   from that of the spouses in sex groups or from the sex-matched life
   expectancy estimates derived from Finnish national statistics. Causes of
   death differed significantly between female probands and spouses. In
   conclusion, obligatory MEN1 gene carrier status did not show a harmful
   effect on survival in this retrospective analysis tracing back to almost
   300 yr.},

Title = {Consequences of high temperatures and premature mortality on the

Abstract = {Elevated river water temperature in the Fraser River, British Columbia,
   Canada, has been associated with enhanced mortality of adult sockeye
   salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) during their upriver migration to spawning
   grounds. We undertook a study to assess the effects of elevated water
   temperatures on the gill transcriptome and blood plasma variables in
   wild-caught sockeye salmon. Naturally migrating sockeye salmon returning
   to the Fraser River were collected and held at ecologically relevant
   temperatures of 14 degrees C and 19 degrees C for seven days, a period
   representing a significant portion of their upstream migration. After
   seven days, sockeye salmon held at 19 degrees C stimulated heat shock
   response genes as well as many genes associated with an immune response
   when compared with fish held at 14 degrees C. Additionally, fish at 19
   degrees C had elevated plasma chloride and lactate, suggestive of a
   disturbance in osmoregulatory homeostasis and a stress response
   detectable in the blood plasma. Fish that died prematurely over the
   course of the holding study were compared with time-matched surviving
   fish; the former fish were characterized by an upregulation of several
   transcription factors associated with apoptosis and downregulation of
   genes involved in immune function and antioxidant activity. Ornithine
   decarboxylase (ODC1) was the most significantly upregulated gene in
   dying salmon, which suggests an association with cellular apoptosis. We
   hypothesize that the observed decrease in plasma ions and increases in
   plasma cortisol that occur in dying fish may be linked to the increase
   in ODC1. By highlighting these underlying physiological mechanisms, this
   study enhances our understanding of the processes involved in premature
   mortality and temperature stress in Pacific salmon during migration to
   spawning grounds.},

Abstract = {Objectives. This study examined premature mortality by county in the
   United States and assessed its association with metro/urban/rural
   geographic location, socioeconomic status, household type, and
   availability of medical care.
   Methods. Age-adjusted years of potential life lost before 75 years of
   age were calculated and mapped by county. Predictors of premature
   mortality were determined by multiple regression analysis.
   Results. Premature mortality was greatest in rural counties in the
   Southeast and Southwest. In a model predicting 55\% of variation across
   counties, community structure factors explained more than availability
   of medical care. The proportions of female-headed households and Black
   populations were the strongest predictors, followed by variables
   measuring low education, American Indian population, and chronic
   unemployment. Greater availability of generalist physicians predicted
   fewer years of life lost in metropolitan counties but more in rural
   counties.
   Conclusions. Community structure factors statistically explain much of
   the variation in premature mortality. The degree to which premature
   mortality is predicted by percentage of female-headed households is
   important for policy-making and delivery of medical care. The
   relationships described argue strongly for broadening the biomedical
   model.},

Title = {Prevalence of secondary care multimorbidity in mid-life and its

Abstract = {Objectives Multimorbidity is the coexistence of two or more health
   conditions in an individual. Multimorbidity in younger adults is
   increasingly recognised as an important challenge. We assessed the
   prevalence of secondary care multimorbidity in mid-life and its
   association with premature mortality over 15 years of follow-up, in the
   Aberdeen Children of the 1950s (ACONF) cohort.
   Method A prospective cohort study using linked electronic health and
   mortality records. Scottish ACONF participants were linked to their
   Scottish Morbidity Record hospital episode data and mortality records.
   Multimorbidity was defined as two or more conditions and was assessed
   using healthcare records in 2001 when the participants were aged between
   45 and 51 years. The association between multimorbidity and mortality
   over 15 years of follow-up (to ages 60-66 years) was assessed using Cox
   proportional hazards regression. There was also adjustment for key
   covariates: age, gender, social class at birth, intelligence at age 7,
   secondary school type, educational attainment, alcohol, smoking, body
   mass index and adult social class.
   Results Of 9625 participants (51\% males), 3\% had multimorbidity. The
   death rate per 1000 person-years was 28.4 (95\% CI 23.2 to 34.8) in
   those with multimorbidity and 5.7 (95\% CI 5.3 to 6.1) in those without.
   In relation to the reference group of those with no multimorbidity,
   those with multimorbidity had a mortality HR of 4.5 (95\% CI 3.4 to 6.0)
   over 15 years and this association remained when fully adjusted for the
   covariates (HR 2.5 (95\% C11.5 to 4.0)).
   Conclusion Multimorbidity prevalence was 3\% in mid-life when measured
   using secondary care administrative data. Multimorbidity in mid-life was
   associated with premature mortality.},

Title = {Premature Mortality from Cardiovascular Disease in the Americas - Will
   the Goal of a Decline of ``25\% by 2025{''} be Met?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Background
   Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the underlying cause 1.6 million
   deaths per year in the Americas, accounting for 30\% of total mortality
   and 38\% of by non-communicable deaths diseases (NCDs). A 25\% reduction
   in premature mortality due four main NCDs was targeted by the 2011
   High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control
   of NCDs. While overall CVD mortality fell in the Americas during the
   past decade, trends in premature CVD mortality during the same period
   have not been described, particularly in the countries of Latin America
   and the Caribbean.
   Methods
   This is a population-based trend-series study based on a total of
   6,133,666 deaths to describe the trends and characteristics of premature
   mortality due to CVD and to estimates of the average annual percentage
   of change during the period 2000-2010 in the Americas.
   Findings
   Premature mortality due to CVD in the Americas fell by 21\% in the
   period 2000-2010 with a -2.5\% average annual rate of change in the last
   5 year-a statistically significant reduction of mortality-. Mortality
   from ischemic diseases, declined by 25\% -24\% among men and 26\% among
   women. Cerebrovascular diseases declined by 27\% -26\% among men and
   28\% among women. Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, the Dominican Republic,
   Bahamas, and Brazil had CVD premature mortality rates over 200 per
   100,000 population, while the average for the Region was 132.7. US and
   Canada will meet the 25\% reduction target before 2025. Mexico, Costa
   Rica, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Panama, Guyana, and El Salvador did
   not significantly reduce premature mortality among men and Guyana, the
   Dominican Republic, and Panama did not achieve the required annual
   reduction in women.
   Conclusions
   Trends in premature mortality due to CVD observed in last decade in the
   Americas would indicate that if these trends continue, the Region as a
   whole and a majority of its countries will be able to reach the goal of
   a 25\% relative reduction in premature mortality even before 2025.},

Abstract = {Objectives. It has been hypothesized that the presence of chronic pain
   causes excess mortality. Since chronic pain is prevalent among patients
   with PsA this potential association should be explored. We aimed to
   investigate whether higher cumulative pain intensity is associated with
   an excess mortality risk in patients with PsA.
   Methods. A nested case-control study using data from the nationwide
   DANBIO Register (Danish Database for Biological Therapies in
   Rheumatology) Register and Danish healthcare registers. Cases were
   patients who died and corresponding to the date of death, matched on
   sex, year of birth and calendar period at the time of death with up to
   five controls. Exposure of interest was mean pain intensity reported
   during the time followed in routine rheumatology practice. Pain
   intensity was measured using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 and
   conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds of mortality
   per 5 unit increase in pain while adjusting for confounders.
   Results. The cohort consisted of 8019 patients. A total of 276 cases
   were identified and matched with 1187 controls. Higher mean pain
   intensity was associated with increased odds of mortality {[}odds ratio
   1.06 (95\% CI 1.02, 1.10)] in the crude model, but there was no
   association {[}odds ratio 0.99 (95\% CI 0.95, 1.03)] when adjusting for
   additional confounders. Factors shown to increase the odds of mortality
   were recent glucocorticoid use, concomitant chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and cardiovascular disease.
   Conclusion. These results indicate that experienced pain in itself is
   not associated with premature mortality in patients with PsA. However,
   recent glucocorticoid use and concurrent comorbidities were.},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
   Study 2019 (GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence,
   morbidity, and mortality to inform local and international efforts
   toward reducing cancer burden.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204
   countries and territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles
   from 2010 to 2019.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe
   cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life
   lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the
   past decade. Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a
   composite measure of educational attainment, income per capita, and
   total fertility rate for those younger than 25 years. Estimates include
   95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
   FINDINGS In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95\% UI,
   22.2-24.9 million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding
   nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 10.0 million (95\% UI, 9.36-10.6 million)
   cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 250 million (235-264 million)
   DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these represented a 26.3\%(95\% UI,
   20.3\%-32.3\%) increase in new cases, a 20.9\%(95\% UI, 14.2\%-27.6\%)
   increase in deaths, and a 16.0\% (95\% UI, 9.3\%-22.8\%) increase in
   DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study,
   cancer was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of
   deaths, years of life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden
   differed across SDI quintiles. The proportion of years lived with
   disability that contributed to DALYs increased with SDI, ranging from
   1.4\%(1.1\%-1.8\%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7\%(4.2\%-7.1\%) in the
   high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest number of
   new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of
   cancer deaths and YDALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage
   increase in the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and
   low-middle SDI quintiles.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this systematic analysis
   suggest that the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing,
   with burden differing by SDI. These results provide comprehensive and
   comparable estimates that can potentially inform efforts toward
   equitable cancer control around the world.},

Title = {Effects of using different exposure data to estimate changes in
   premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 and O-3 in China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {The assessment of premature mortality associated with the dramatic
   changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) has important
   scientific significance and provides valuable information for future
   emission control strategies. Exposure data are particularly vital but
   may cause great uncertainty in health burden assessments. This study,
   for the first time, used six methods to generate the concentration data
   of PM2.5 and O-3 in China between 2014 and 2018, and then quantified the
   changes in premature mortality due to PM2.5 and O-3 using the
   Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition
   (BenMAP-CE) model. The results show that PM2.5-related premature
   mortality in China decreases by 263 (95\% confidence interval (CI95):
   142-159) to 308 (CI95: 213-241) thousands from 2014 to 2018 by using
   different concentration data, while O-3-related premature mortality
   increases by 67 (CI95: 26-104) to 103 (CI95: 40-163) thousands. The
   estimated mean changes are up to 40\% different for the PM2.5-related
   mortality, and up to 30\% for the O-3-related mortality if different
   exposure data are chosen. The most significant difference due to the
   exposure data is found in the areas with a population density of around
   10(3) people/km(2), mostly located in Central China, for both PM2.5 and
   O-3. Our results demonstrate that the exposure data source significantly
   affects mortality estimations and should thus be carefully considered in

Title = {Long-term trends and spatial patterns of PM2.5-induced premature
   mortality in South and Southeast Asia from 1999 to 2014},

Abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) poses a potential threat to human
   health, including premature mortality under long-term exposure. Based on
   a long-term series of high-resolution (0.01(.) x 0.01(.))
   satellite-retrieved PM(2.5 )concentrations, this study estimated the
   premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 in South and Southeast Asia
   (SSEA) from 1999 to 2014. Then, the long-term trends and spatial
   characteristics of PM2.5-induced premature deaths (1999-2014) were
   analyzed using trend analyses and standard deviation ellipses. Results
   showed the estimated number of PM2.5-induced average annual premature
   deaths in SSEA was 1,447,000. The numbers increased from 1,179,400 in
   1999 to 1,724,900 in 2014, with a growth rate of 38\% and net increase
   of 545,500. Stroke and ischemic heart disease were the two principal
   contributors, accounting for 39\% and 35\% of the total, respectively.
   High values were concentrated in North India, Bangladesh, East Pakistan,
   and some metropolitan areas of Southeast Asia. An estimated 991.600
   deaths in India was quantified (i.e., -69\% of the total premature
   deaths in SSEA). The long-term trends (1999-2014) of PM2.5-related
   premature mortality exhibited consistent incremental tendencies in all
   countries except Sri Lanka. The findings of this study suggest that
   strict controls of PM(2.5)concentrations in SSEA are urgently required.

Title = {Increase in premature mortality due to non-communicable diseases in Sri
   Lanka during the first decade of the twenty-first century},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {Background: Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCD) are the leading
   cause of death and more than 40\% of NCD deaths are premature occurring
   before the age of 70 years. In 2012, World Health Assembly declared its
   commitment to reduce premature NCD mortality by 25\% from 2010 to 2025.
   The trend of premature NCD deaths in Sri Lanka has not been assessed and
   thus this study was done to assess it between 2001 to 2010.
   Methods: Deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic
   respiratory diseases and diabetes were studied. Premature NCD mortality
   was assessed using unconditional probability of dying (UPoD) due to NCDs
   among those aged 30 to 70 years. Number of relevant premature NCD deaths
   that occurred in each 5-year age interval and the respective mid year
   population was used to calculate UPoD.
   Results: During the period of 2001 to 2010, premature NCD mortality in
   Sri Lanka increased from 15.8\% to 19.1\% and males showed higher
   mortality compared to females throughout the period. Highest mortality
   was due to cardiovascular diseases followed by cancer and diabetes and
   all three showed an increasing trend. Chronic respiratory diseases
   showed an increase until 2004 and dropped thereafter. Among the four
   NCDs, diabetes revealed the most marked increasing trend in premature
   mortality during this period.
   Conclusions: The data revealed an increasing trend of premature NCD
   mortality in Sri Lanka between 2001 and 2010 although it has a
   relatively lower premature NCD mortality rate in the South-East Asian
   Region. Therefore, reducing premature NCD mortality by 25\% from 2010 to
   2025 is likely to be a rather challenging task in Sri Lanka and policy
   level changes need to be taken to achieve this target.},
